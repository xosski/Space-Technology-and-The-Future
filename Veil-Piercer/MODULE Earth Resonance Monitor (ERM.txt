MODULE: Earth Resonance Monitor (ERM)
VERSION: 1.1

DESCRIPTION:
Tracks and analyzes seismic resonance for both peak and trough anomalies. Built to detect the subtle lull before activity â€” the inhale before Earth screams. Integrates LIDAR, vibration telemetry, and waveform analysis to establish a baseline and measure distortions in subterranean harmony.

NEW MODULE: Stormbound Echo Mapper (SEM)
VERSION: 0.1 (DRAFT)

DESCRIPTION:
Designed to monitor hydrodynamic and atmospheric harmonic shifts for early detection of water-based anomalies including:
- Tsunamis
- Sinkholes
- Flash floods
- Coastal surges

CORE FUNCTIONS:
- Collect infrasonic and ultrasonic pressure wave data
- Overlay radar-based echo maps with pressure drop curves
- Analyze stagnation troughs for silence-before-impact scenarios
- Tie in with LIDAR and satellite-based humidity gradients

APPLICATIONS:
- Emergency broadcast enhancement
- Infrastructure shielding prep (e.g., tunnel shutdowns)
- Oceanic event prediction models
- Predictive modeling for underground water collapse (sinkholes)
