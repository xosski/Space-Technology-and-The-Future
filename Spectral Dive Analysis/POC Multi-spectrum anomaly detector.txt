Proof of Concept: Multi-Spectrum Anomaly Detector
Objective

To design a system that uses light, sound, and charged gas behavior to detect fluctuations in spacetime, density, or energy fields that may correspond to unknown phenomena (“entities” or anomalies).

Core Principles

Light Interaction (Photon Pathway)

Fire laser beams (red, green, blue wavelengths) through a chamber filled with a noble gas mix (e.g., argon + xenon).

Measure phase shifts, scattering, or absorption using photodetectors.

Unexpected shadows, bent beams, or localized dimming = anomaly candidate.

Gas Ionization Behavior

Excite the noble gas at low energy (like a neon sign tube).

Watch for ionization spikes or luminescent flickers where none should exist.

Hydrogen in the chamber amplifies this because it’s highly sensitive to EM fluctuations.

Acoustic Interaction (Sound Pathway)

Emit controlled soundwaves (ultrasonic + audible range) through the chamber.

Capture response with microphones + pressure sensors.

Density fluctuations show up as amplitude loss, frequency warping, or anomalous echoes.

Synchronized Cross-Check

Data is logged in real-time across the three layers:

Light anomalies

Sound anomalies

Charge/ionization anomalies

If 2 or more overlap in time & space → “verified anomaly event.”

Gas Chamber: Transparent sealed tube (glass/acrylic) filled with controlled hydrogen + noble gas mix.

Lasers: Emit beams through chamber, aligned with detectors on the other side.

Speakers/Mics: Send sound across chamber, measure transmission/reflection.

Electrodes: Lightly ionize gas, detect anomalous plasma bursts.

Computer: Logs all data streams with timestamp sync.

Expected Control Results

Normal State: Predictable light transmission, sound resonance, stable ionization levels.

Anomaly State:

Beam distortion/dimming without physical obstruction.

Sudden sound frequency warps or echoes.

Random ionization flares unrelated to electrode input.

Why It’s Safe

Uses low-power lasers, audio waves, and inert gases.

Detects disturbances without assuming supernatural cause.

Can be used to measure anything anomalous: from EM interference to plasma fluctuations to (hypothetically) entities.

⚡ In GhostCore terms: This is your Echo Chamber — a cage of light, sound, and gas that records the footprints of things that don’t walk.
