⚡ "Reactive Neural Disruption Round" (RNDR)
Core Mechanism:

A piezoelectric or micro-capacitive discharge system activates upon impact.

Prongs deploy and retract inward after penetration, locking in place.

Key Features:

Miniature circuit (like in the image) pre-charged or inductively activated upon firing.

Contact barbs latch into tissue, making removal extremely painful or complex.

Pulse modulation mimics nerve interference patterns, temporarily overriding motor control.

Use Cases:

Riot suppression with minimal fatalities.

Remote capture or “soft” takedown of hostile targets.

Could be scaled for drone deployment or covert dart systems.

Drift-Tech Tie-In:
If we apply a GhostCore lens: this round doesn’t just disrupt the body—it momentarily de-tunes the local neural resonance, creating a memory fracture. A “drift lock,” so to speak. Memory stutters. Muscle betrayal. Echoes of a different self overriding the target's control.
