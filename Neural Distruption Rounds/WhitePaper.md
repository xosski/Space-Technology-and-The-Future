White Paper: Reactive Neural Disruption Round (RNDR)

Version 0.91a - DriftTech Applications & GhostCore Considerations

Executive Summary:

The Reactive Neural Disruption Round (RNDR) is a tactical projectile designed to incapacitate targets through localized neural interference. It leverages embedded micro-electrical systems, compact prong deployment mechanisms, and pulse-based modulation to override motor function and temporarily fracture memory continuity. Originally conceptualized for non-lethal tactical use, RNDR represents a bridge between kinetic weaponry and drift-based neurological influence.

1. System Architecture

1.1 Physical Form Factor

Caliber: Compatible with standard rifle and pistol rounds (9mm, 5.56mm, etc.)

Material: Composite polymer shell with electro-reactive core

Tip: Contact prongs with mechanical retraction upon penetration

1.2 Electrical Core

Power: Micro-capacitor charged pre-deployment or via magnetic induction

Trigger: Impact sensor or biometric proximity activator

Output: 15-35 kV pulse modulation

1.3 Neurological Payload

Pulse Pattern: Oscillating neural override (ON/OFF bursts 4-8 Hz)

Duration: Configurable (5s, 30s, continuous until battery depletion)

Effect: Temporary neuromuscular incapacitation; potential memory disorientation

2. Tactical Use Cases

2.1 Crowd Control / Non-Lethal Engagement

Targets can be disabled from a distance of 200-500m

Lower collateral risk compared to explosive or blunt options

2.2 Covert Extraction / Asset Capture

Maintains target viability for interrogation or recovery

Reduces traceable physical damage, especially in GhostCore-sensitive environments

2.3 Anti-Infiltration / Automated Defense

Integration with autonomous turrets or aerial drones

Ideal for low-visibility enforcement without violating kinetic thresholds

3. GhostCore Integration Potential

3.1 Drift Lock Mechanics

Induced micro-seizure or memory stutter upon activation

Creates temporal "drift gaps" where victim's timeline continuity may fracture

3.2 WraithHalo Compatibility

RNDR could double as a signal injector for WraithHalo tracking or tagging

May include Lazarus Ping echo upon target loss-of-consciousness

3.3 Ethical Concerns & Doctrinal Safeguards

Possibility of permanent mnemonic disassociation in weak-mind profiles

Requires CrossLayer verification before deployment in civpop zones

4. Future Enhancements

4.1 Adaptive Pulse Patterning

Customizes frequency based on biofeedback

4.2 Biometric Sync Lock

Only activates on predefined neuro-signatures

4.3 Multi-Round Coordination

Syncs multiple rounds to create an EM field disruption net

Conclusion:

RNDR is not merely a bullet. It is a precision neurosurgical tool disguised as ordnance. It represents the next evolution in controlled conflict, where the body is neutralized, the mind is paused, and the story—the drift—is rewritten. In the GhostCore Era, power lies not in death, but in the art of interruption.

Welcome to the Wraith Age.
