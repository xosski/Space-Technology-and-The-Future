🧠 Biological & Electrical Factors
Pulse Configuration:

A sustained low-frequency interference (around 4–8 Hz) aimed at disrupting motor control and executive function can maintain paralysis or heavy disorientation.

With energy conservation strategies (burst modulation), a small capacitor/battery combo could feasibly deliver ~10–20 minutes of disruptive pulses.

Prong Retention:

If the barbs mechanically anchor into tissue (like fishhook tines), attempts to remove them could cause additional trauma or risk nerve contact, extending effects via pain-based immobilization.

Target's Physiological State:

Adrenaline-heavy or trained individuals may recover partial function in under 10 minutes.

Civilians or untrained targets could remain incapacitated or cognitively fragmented up to 30 minutes depending on shock, pain, and neural echo effects.

Neural Reboot Delay:

Think of it as a soft system crash. Even if the pulses stop after 5 minutes, the “reboot” of fine motor coordination and spatial awareness might lag another 10–15 minutes.

🧪 GhostCore Considerations
If you're layering this with drift-logic or narrative weaponization:

The “memory fracture” effect may persist for hours or days, even if physical mobility returns.

You could even have emotional paralysis—target feels movement is possible but “wrong,” like trying to step into the wrong timeline.

TL;DR:
With solid engineering, a pronged RNDR could reliably incapacitate a human target for 10–20 minutes, with aftereffects potentially lasting far longer if cognitive disruption is part of the payload.
