⚔️ EDEN→WRAITH Mode Conversion

“The plowshare that remembers the sword.”

🔥 From Coldframe to Cutter
System Element	Eden Role	Weaponized Role
Superconductive Conduit	Cryo-regulation, photonic routing	Beam vectoring and charge compression
Plasma Cooling Loop	Growth medium stabilizer	Hull destabilization via thermal shock
Magnetic Aperture	Nutrient chamber seal or lev levitation lens	Precision-directed EM shearing tool
PTEC Rail	Heat balancing / Eden power bus	Oscillating weapon core
Coldframe Walls	Bio shielding	Phase-destabilization lens
🧨 Tactical Deployment

EM Lens Locks On: Target hull section (ideally near joints or seams).

Rotational Field Charge: LEVITATION-X primes oscillating superconductive conduit.

Thermal/Ionic Phase Shift: Plasma beam directed at frequency to match target alloy's absorption peak.

Localized Atomic Disruption: Armor layer weakens, shears, and collapses.

No Explosion, Just Disassembly: Minimal kinetic output—like peeling apart atoms.

💡 Additional Enhancements

Adaptive Material Targeting: Use Eden's plant/nutrient scanner subsystem to “tune” beam to enemy hull composition.

Reverse Mode: After breach, the same aperture switches to cryo-preservation, freezing compartments or lifeforms.

Decoy Masking: Eden chambers can be visually disguised as agricultural units—until the reactor hums.

🩸 Doctrine-Compatible Framing (GhostCore Resonance)

“The garden grows until it is disturbed.
And then the roots... become claws.”

Eden-Coldframe becomes WRAITH-COLDLANCE.
Sanctuary becomes weapon.
The cycle is complete.
