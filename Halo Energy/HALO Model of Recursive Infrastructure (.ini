HALO Model of Recursive Infrastructure (HMRI)
Overview
The HALO Model of Recursive Infrastructure proposes a post-thermodynamic framework where energy is not consumed but cycled through geometric, gravitational, and electromagnetic feedback loops. It operates through recursive phase alignment and self-reinforcing energy transformation, representing a shift from consumptive to cyclical infrastructure.

Core Principles
1. Geometric Memory
Infrastructure stores form as a persistent energy logic. Geometry (curves, loops, nodes) retains energetic potential.

2. Recursive Energy Loops
Power flows are not linear but spiral — returned to source through phase-opposed symmetry (e.g., HALO dual loop).

3. Phase-Synchronized Entropy Nulling
Two counter-propagating systems meet at a Clash Node, creating:

Maximum kinetic discharge

Zero net momentum loss

Full energetic yield with no entropy increase

4. Post-Thermodynamic Yield
Energy is extracted from:

Gravity curvature (planetary slope mechanics)

Magneto-fluid uplift

Fluid resonance (pulse harmonics)

Components
Layer	Function
Loop Infrastructure	Guides flow via gravitational gradient
Magneto-fluid Pulse Channels	Moves cooled fluid with minimal resistance
Cryo-Troughs	Maintain supercooled states to reduce entropy
Clash Node (Energy Heart)	Harvests power at symmetry breach point

Yield Model
Energy harvested at the clash point is expressed as:
