I. Overview

This Proof-of-Concept outlines a rotating polyhedral energy structure — the Prismatic Tesseract Energy Core (PTEC) — designed to serve as a dynamic plasma-based wireless power system within large-scale spacecraft or orbital infrastructure. PTEC combines rotational induction, charge oscillation, and geometric resonance to generate, stabilize, and direct plasma energy through configurable vectors.

It can function in isolation or as a mobile SkyTear node, capable of projecting energy to ground receivers, nearby vessels, or internal ship systems.

II. Structural Design
1. Outer Prism Rotation Mechanism

Four vertical induction rails rotate around a central core

Top and bottom triangular gates open to direct energy pulses

Rotation introduces phase lag → amplifies induction via spatial displacement

2. Internal Chamber

Spirit Boxes: Dual plasma reservoirs

Alternate positive and negative charge states

Held in oscillating phase, creating continuous AC field without mechanical friction

Field Suspension: Plasma is never in contact with chamber walls — held via magnetic lensing

3. Geometry

Outer shape: Tetrahedral prism (or projected tesseract)

Supports standing wave harmonics and directional bias

Enables predictive energy shaping and collimation

III. Energy Generation Principles
Mechanism	Function
Rotational Induction	Spinning rails induce charge via motion through electromagnetic containment fields
Charge Oscillation	Plasma alternates polarity across two containers, generating continuous usable energy without exhaust
Geometric Resonance	Field harmonics are amplified across nodal paths of the tetrahedron, reducing loss and enabling vector output
Field Containment Medium:

Supercooled cold plasma with metamaterial-stabilized containment arrays

Redundant field stabilizers anchored to vessel spine or orbital scaffold

IV. Operational Modes
A. Internal Power Routing (Closed State)

Prism gates sealed

All energy routed into internal ship systems (propulsion, fabrication, shielding, habitation)

B. External Wireless Transfer (Open State)

Prism gates open

Energy pulses channeled through top or bottom prism gates

Compatible with SkyTear IRR arrays, inductive umbilicals, or field-capture drones

C. Pulse Synchronization Mode

Unit phase-locks with nearby reactor for burst-level energy syncing

Supports emergency relay to damaged or power-depleted ships

V. Use Cases
Environment	Use
Orbital Platform	Stationary PTEC node charges vehicles or ground infrastructure below
Flagship Vessel Core	Mobile energy source with internal/external routing
Planetary Surface Base	Ground-facing prism gates enable direct energy delivery to subterranean systems
Emergency Pulse Relay	Redirect power to field med-frames, energy barriers, or distant colony sites
VI. Safety & Stability Protocols

Charge isolation via opposing polarity chambers

Rotational failsafe disengages if angular velocity exceeds harmonic sync thresholds

Prism gate override locks during overload or external magnetic interference

Field resonance dampeners to avoid sympathetic feedback into nearby unshielded systems

VII. Integration With GhostCore Systems

Directly interfaces with SkyTear IRR (Inductive Resonance Receivers) 【97†Orbital Induction Network】

Compatible with WraithHalo frequency encoding

Field structures can be modulated by Network AI Relay Core (NARC) to direct bursts dynamically

Internal plasma harmonics can be embedded with GhostNet cryptofields for signal-paired delivery

VIII. Philosophical Alignment

“You don’t store energy. You shape where it wants to go.”

PTEC honors the GhostCore principle of energetic intent, not passive collection. The ship becomes a ritual geometry — a heart that doesn’t beat, but radiates purpose.

IX. Limitations & Development Targets
Limitation	Current Status
Plasma phase flicker at high RPM	Under simulation correction
Cross-vessel resonance misfires	Solved with NARC-guided frequency pairing
Gate fracture under power surge	Reinforced metamaterial ribbing added
Heat bleed under emergency ejection	Redundant lattice dampeners pending field test
X. Conclusion

The Prismatic Tesseract Energy Core transforms vessels from passive containers into geometric field engines. It channels resonance instead of fuel, encodes charge instead of burning it, and breathes energy into the void — not through wires, but through will.

It is not just a reactor. It is intention, made radiant.

Let the prism open. Let the pulse be chosen.
