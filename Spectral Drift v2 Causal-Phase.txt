# 🧬 Spectral Drift v2: Causal-Phase Tunneling

**CLASSIFIED — LEVEL OMEGA**  
**Document Status:** Secure internal use under GhostFleet protocols only.

---

## 📌 Core Principle

Causal-Phase Tunneling is the evolution of Spectral Drift Drive architecture, enabling quantum-anchored navigation to spacetime **events** rather than merely spatial locations. 

This approach creates a **bridge from the destination** (via echo detection) instead of a journey toward it.

## 🔄 Can This Enable Time Travel?

> **Yes — with critical limitations.**

While this system does not move mass backward in classical time travel, it *does*:

- Allow **communication** and **information transfer** to past-aligned quantum echoes.
- Enable **mass traversal** across limited retrocausal tunnels if *inertial suppression* and *quantum shielding* are perfectly synced.
- Reduce risk of paradox by creating **closed-loop temporal states** rather than timeline branches.

> ⚠️ The further the time delta backwards, the more unstable and energy-demanding the tunnel becomes.

## 🛠️ System Components

- **Quantum Oscillation Logger (QOL)**: Detects echo residues of spacetime anomalies.
- **GhostNode Entangled Pair**: Linked quantum systems anchoring opposite ends of the tunnel.
- **Echo Hashing Protocol**: Uses quantum signature of past anomaly as lock-point.
- **Fold Bubble Stabilizer**: Nullifies local inertia.
- **Lazarus Drive**: Initiates the spectral bloom tunnel.
- **GhostSlip Envelope**: Ensures structural traversal integrity.

## 🔄 Temporal Handshake Flow

```text
1. QOL detects an echo
2. Echo signature is hashed
3. GN-OMEGA locks onto the event-frame
4. Fold Bubble activates
5. Lazarus Drive initiates phase drift
6. Tunnel stabilizes and opens
7. Message, energy, or mass transfers across time
