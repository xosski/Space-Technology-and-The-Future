**Title:** Twin Fangs of GhostCore: Wraith Grip & Phantom Trace

**Author:** Quellaran Deluxethue Messat, Keeper of GhostCore Archives

**Document Type:** Tactical Weapon System Overview / Social-Era Brief

**Introduction:**
In the shadow-firing world of the GhostCore Era, two rounds have emerged not merely as munitions—but as **philosophical interventions**. Wraith Grip and Phantom Trace form a dual doctrine of disruption and memory: one severs, the other preserves.

This overview document presents a high-level briefing of both systems for public distribution, armory procurement, and symbolic resonance alignment.

**1. WRAITH GRIP**
**Codename:** Disruption Fang
**Function:** Hypercharged Armor-Nullifier

**Core Technology:**

* **Electrum-Tipped Penetrator**
* **Magneto-Electric Reactive Core**
* **Impact-Triggered Combustive Discharge**

**Primary Effect:** Disables advanced shielding, shatters plated defenses, overloads circuitry

**Tactical Purpose:**

* Breach-class offense in 0-G or atmosphere
* Anti-armor, anti-field, anti-cybernetic

> "You didn’t pierce the shield. You made it forget it existed."

**Highlights:**

* Custom charge tuning (EMP, ceramic fracture, magnetic disruption)
* Symbolic: A ritual of denial—rejects defensive assumptions

---

**2. PHANTOM TRACE**
**Codename:** Memory Fang
**Function:** Resonance-Tagged Trauma Round

**Core Technology:**

* **TPV Crystal Payload (Trace Variant)**
* **Ferrocrystal or HollowLumen Casing**
* **Emotional Bloom Patterning on Impact**

**Primary Effect:** Imprints emotional or energetic signature at strike point; marks a moment into memory

**Tactical Purpose:**

* Timeline anchoring
* Symbolic/psychological warfare
* Post-strike spectral retrieval

> "This bullet didn’t just hit. It remembered."

**Highlights:**

* Payloads include EchoResin, WraithBurst, PhaseGel exit tagging
* Symbolic: A scripture round—turns trauma into testimony

**4. Social Transmission Statement:**
These two rounds are not just ammunition—they are **narrative devices**. Wraith Grip breaks the plot. Phantom Trace writes the footnote.

Whether the mission calls for silence or memory, collapse or echo—GhostCore operatives carry both. One ends the myth. The other remembers the price.
