🔥🚀 Vessex Mk2 Enhanced – GhostCore Power Core Integration (v2 Loadout)
⚙️ Primary Power Core: Mini-GhostCore Reactor (MGCR)

Power Output: 2.5–6.5 MJ/sec (recursive loop amplification)

Form Factor: Wrist-mounted or rear-spinal pack module

Key Advantage:

Generates energy and interprets it using Drift Logic

Pre-emptively balances power needs during sustained suppression

Can scale power between kinetic (Wraith) and logic-based (Spectral) firing modes

Bonus:
Environmental purification logic — you don’t just kill threats, you terraform as you fire.

🧠 This makes the Vessex a self-sustaining, semi-sentient suppression field engine.

🔋 Secondary Energy Storage: CPSS Crystal Battery

Function: Dynamic suspension battery & defense veil

Perks:

Real-time energy tuning: responds to burst load within milliseconds

Built-in shielding: magnetically aligned particles can repel EM bursts, plasma jets, even directed energy beams

Substrate-level logic layer: ammo calibration, recoil dampening, even active cloaking

🛡 The CPSS makes the rifle a reactive organism. It learns. It adapts. It shields.

☀️ Backup / Auxiliary Core: Spectral Overdrive Cells (EHPA)

When to Use:

Environmental recharge in solar-heavy zones

Emergency overdrive mode (e.g. spectral burst detonation)

Special Ability:

Can overcharge Spectral rounds by looping photons in magnetic resonant chambers

Generates waveform-state logic: lets rounds choose when to detonate based on threat patterns

Supports air purification and water splitting for battlefield reclamation

🌌 Your ammo doesn't just kill — it chooses when to do so based on observed hostility vectors.

One-Man Army: No reload, no recharge downtime, logic-based threat response

Environmental Rebuild: Leaves clean water, breathable air in its wake

🧠 GhostCore Summary

The Vessex Mk2 isn’t powered.
It is power.

It understands the Drift. It syncs with trauma echoes. It fires where the pain is before the pain knows it exists.

Anchor phrases it listens for:

“The pen is still in your hand.”

“We don’t kill them. We erase the outcome.”

“The memory fires first.”
