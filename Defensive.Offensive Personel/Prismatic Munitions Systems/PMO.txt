Prismatic Munitions Overlay
⚔️ Prismatic Munition System (PMS) — GhostCore Weapon POC

Title: Dual-State, High-Velocity Combat Munitions
Class: Multi-Mode Plasma-Enhanced Ballistic Rounds
Design Author: Quellaran Deluxethue Messat
Cycle Tier: Echo-Trauma Combat Standard | DriftEra P5

📌 Core Design Concepts (From Your Images)
⚙ Round Composition:

Dual-Prism Charge Stack: Two prismatic elements spin or align to split a Thallium-based plasma/electrical charge across different geometries

Selective Discharge Pathing: One path delivers solid piercing force, the other disperses for area saturation or personnel neutralization

Split-Charge Cartridge: The round internally shifts the charge vector — like splitting a beam or electrical arc

💡 Functional Munition Modes
Mode I – Piercing Core (Anti-Armor)

Uses a solid penetrator with magnetic or plasma acceleration

Prism directs charge to reinforce kinetic tip

Goal: breach high-density shielding or hull layers (Revenant-class plating, etc.)

Mode II – Fracture Core (Anti-Personnel)

Internal matrix fractures on impact or timed detonation

Plasma/electricity release upon burst

Shrapnel is ionically charged for enhanced tissue disruption / EM flash effects

↺ Mid-Combat Hot-Swap Capable

Ammunition feeds from dual-bay, synced to suit/weapon input

Switch round function instantly (physical or magnetic selector)

Ideal for boarding, zero-G, and multi-target environments

🔋 Prism Charge Mechanics

Your sketch and text describe using prism elements inside the cartridge, similar to what we now use in shield nodes.

This is brilliant and possible if designed as a micro spin-gate emitter within each shell.
The Thallium Charge becomes the energy medium.

Advantages of Prism Charge in Ammo:

Electrically polarizable projectile envelope

Can be charged mid-flight by coil or field rail systems

Plasma shockwave trails or EM stinger effects (like tracer rounds but hotter)

🔨 Ammunition Shell Architecture (Class Names)

| Name | Role | Notes |
|--------------------------|------|-------|\n| PRAEFECTUS RND-01 | Armor-piercing plasma kinetic round | “Prefect” of destruction, spear of judgment\n| PHANTASM RND-04 | Fragmentation/EM pulse hybrid | Dispersion shell — Wraith-type burst\n| REVENANT SHARD-RND-Σ | Dual-load round that switches based on charge | Recalls target's shield frequency from past hits\n| WRAITHCORE HVC-M | High velocity conductive round | Electrically tuned to enemy harmonics\n\n---

📦 Suggested Weapon Platform

Name: Echo Lance or GhostSpine

Modular coilgun / rail hybrid

Accepts Prism-Charge Munition Shells (PCMS)

AI target harmonization for round-type syncing

Fire delay compensation synced to GhostCore predictive combat matrix

💀 Tactical Use Case

“The first shot breaks the wall.
The second walks through like it’s been here before.”

A GhostCore soldier uses these rounds not to overwhelm, but to rewrite the enemy’s shielding logic. Once the prism charge tags the frequency, every round after it harmonizes with a deeper layer of that target’s energy pattern.
