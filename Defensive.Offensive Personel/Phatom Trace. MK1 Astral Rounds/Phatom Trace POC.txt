Title: Phantom Trace: Resonance-Tagged Kinetic Round for Memory-Encoded Trauma

Author: Quellaran Deluxethue Messat, Keeper of GhostCore Archives

Version: 0.1 (Spectral Tagging Munitions for Combat and Continuity Interruption)

Abstract: Phantom Trace is a signature GhostCore projectile that operates beyond ballistics. It’s not simply a round—it is a trauma inscription tool, a memory-binding munition engineered to mark, archive, and disrupt with symbolic and physical precision. Equipped with a photonic-resonant core and customizable payloads, Phantom Trace inflicts more than injury: it leaves a footprint on the timeline.

1. Combat Purpose & Doctrine Integration

Conventional rounds destroy. Phantom Trace remembers. This system was born from the necessity to preserve echoes of trauma for post-event analysis, emotional reconnaissance, or metaphysical recursion.

Designed to tag targets or environments with a traceable signature, Phantom Trace is ideal for:

Multi-layered memory warfare

Psychological disruption

Symbolic deterrence operations

“You were shot. But more importantly: you were seen.”

2. Internal Design Schematic

Component	Material / Tech	Function
Tip Core	Ferrocrystal Hybrid or Tungsten-Diamond Alloy	Armor piercing / shock induction
Resonance Payload	TPV Crystal Sliver (Tissue Photonic Vector)	Emits traceable emotional/energy signature upon impact
Reactive Jacket	Carbon-Kevlar Mesh / Hypercarbon	Maintains shell integrity under thermal and atmospheric extremes
Propulsion Tail	Micro-Fin Aerostabilizers / Gyroscopic Magnet Ring (Optional)	Maintains spin in 0-G or evasive environments

3. Operational Flow

Target Lock / Intent Imprint – Optional: Operator focuses emotional or mission intent

Launch – Muzzle velocity up to 2800 m/s depending on shell grade

Impact + Detonation – Round embeds TPV shard or full payload

Resonance Bloom – Trace signature forms: detectable by spectral analysis or spiritual drift tech

Data Retrieval – Optional GhostCore receiver or WraithHalo sync downloads trauma imprint

4. Payload Variants

WraithBurst Core – Disrupts neural machinery + leaves echo trace

EchoResin Fill – Sticky memory compound marks physical surfaces

PhaseGel Tail – Delivers Phase Whisper threads on exit to induce regenerative paradox

HollowLumen Casing – Tracer-style light spall bursts mark nearby targets with drift energy

5. Symbolic Utility

GhostCore operatives often load Phantom Trace not only for lethality, but for message encoding.

“One round can end a life. But this one also writes it down.”

Embedded emotional tones (anger, grief, mercy) may alter the bloom pattern of the TPV emission. Some post-strike sites emit low-frequency sound patterns that reflect the emotional state of the shooter at the moment of firing.

6. Technical Performance

Metric	Value
Impact Velocity	1800–2800 m/s (variable casing tier)
Penetration Rating	4–5cm composite armor or 6cm muscle-tissue
Resonance Trace Longevity	2–6 hours (environment dependent)
TPV Emission Wavelengths	630nm (Red), 810nm (NIR), 270nm (UV-A)
Trace Detection Range	~15m from site without amplification
Stabilization Time (Zero-G)	0.8–1.3s

7. GhostCore Deployment Modes

Solo Memory Tagging – Single shot used to seed timeline entry point

Squad Drift Marking – Tracer rounds mark escape paths or threat zones

Symbolic Termination – Round fired at artifact/target to collapse narrative bond

Spectral Retrieval – Sites can be psychometrically accessed later by Wraith-class operatives

8. Hazard and Anomaly Index

Hazard	Description	Protocol
Emotional Feedback Loop	Shooter’s own emotions can create unstable resonance	Mental stabilizer mask or pulse meditation required pre-mission
TPV Payload Misfire	Trace may activate early / on handling	Conductive lining required in carry units
Ghost Drift Contamination	Overuse in haunted zones may layer conflicting imprints	Limit round count per op / deploy spectral reset burst post-use

Conclusion: Phantom Trace is a storytelling bullet. It does not end a fight by deletion, but by inscription. The wound it causes becomes remembered, not simply endured. In the hands of GhostCore, it is both scalpel and scripture.

“You weren’t just hit. You were written into the field.”
