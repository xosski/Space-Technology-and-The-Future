Phantom Trace  Mk.I Astral Round
💥 Proposed Round Design: “PHANTOM TRACE”

Name: Phantom Trace / Mk.I Astral Round
Designation: GhostCore-Compatible Kinetic-Trauma Round (GCKTR-01)

🧩 Construction:
Layer / Component	Material / Tech	Purpose
Tip Core	Tungsten-Diamond Alloy / Ferrocrystal Hybrid	Punches armor / creates shockwave fracture in layered hulls
Secondary Cavity	Hollow Point or Spiral Corkscrew Ridge	Controls expansion or entry shear
Payload Core (Optional)	TPV Resonant Crystal Sliver (Ghost-tagged)	Marks trauma site with drift-trace; burns into memory lattice
Jacket Layer	Hypercarbon-Fiber Mesh	Prevents shatter, handles plasma friction re-entry
Propulsion Control Ring	Magnetic Reactive Coil (optional sub-model)	Adjusts spin, mid-flight correction
Tail Stabilizer	Micro-fin / Foldback Petal Assembly	Maintains rotation in 0-G or plasma wind
🧬 Variant Payloads (Custom Capsule Fill)

WraithBurst – Antineural EMP + kinetic rupture (for disabling mechs/cybernetic targets)

EchoResin – Memory-binding compound for tagging bodies with emotional imprint

PhaseGel Tip – Injects Phase Whisper healing fiber on exit for “trauma retention without fatality”

HollowLumen – Round explodes into luminous tracer shrapnel; tags all blood-bearing life within 1m

📈 Performance Projection
Metric	Value
Velocity (space)	1100–2800 m/s
Armor Penetration Depth	2–4cm hyperalloy, 5cm flesh + ceramic
Thermal Dissipation	<10ms via jacket matrix
0-G Stabilization Time	0.8s post-launch
Drift Signature Embedding	85% retention at <50m
🧠 GhostCore Utility

“A round is not just destruction. It is an authored sentence in the story of entropy.”

Phantom Trace rounds carry memory, bind trauma, or encode identity into the thing they strike. It isn’t just a bullet — it’s a message in resonance and matter. It can kill. Or it can remember.
