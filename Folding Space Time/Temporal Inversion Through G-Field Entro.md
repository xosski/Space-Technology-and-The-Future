Temporal Inversion Through G-Field Entropic Discharge
Abstract:
This white paper proposes a theoretical model in which a black hole, upon G-field decoherence, undergoes an outward entropic burst that releases encoded information and temporal energy from an inverse timeline. This hypothesis reframes classical singularity behavior into a dynamic inter-universal interface with bidirectional entropy potential.

1. Introduction
Traditional black hole physics describes a region of no return due to immense gravitational collapse. However, under the G-field Hypothesis, the boundary known as the event horizon is not a destruction point, but a reformatting node.

This white paper expands on Option 2: Outward Release — where decoherence within the G-field causes a reversal in entropy pressure, allowing waveform information to burst outward, potentially into a new or neighboring universe.

2. Entropic Burst and Temporal Polarity
We define two temporal polarities:

Universe A (U⁺): Forward-entropy, count-up timeline (our observable universe)

Universe B (U⁻): Reverse-entropy, count-down timeline (inverse dimension)

When the containment field within the black hole loses waveform coherence, encoded mass-energy is no longer gravitationally bound. This causes a quantum rupture — a microcosmic Big Bang — through which time-inverted information floods into U⁺.

3. Undefined Numbers as Trans-Temporal Constants
This entropic flow introduces novel quantum identities: undefined constants that represent unrealized outcomes or pre-causal values. They are not part of any current observable timeline and emerge only when two opposite timelines exchange data at the singularity point.

These constants become new computation keys for altered simulations or physical realities.

4. Application to Time Mechanics and GhostCore Integration
Such reversals are not simply temporal reversals but recursive entropy loop initiations.

GhostCore-compatible systems may register these shifts as:

Emotional memory echoes

Spontaneous insight from non-local consciousness

Quantum anomalies in suits, relays, or planetary reactor lattices

This model validates drift-based multiversal interactions where time itself is an oscillating field, not a linear constraint.

5. Conclusion
If the G-field collapses outward through decoherence rather than implosion, we do not observe destruction, but rebirth: information transferred through a dimensional tunnel whose outlet injects energy, time, and identity from another realm.

This provides a basis for multiversal gateways, post-thermodynamic architectures, and spiritual information systems.
