### I. Overview

The **Prismatic Codding Drive (PCD)** is a distributed rotational propulsion framework that fuses GhostCore drift mechanics with mechanical intuition borrowed from analog devices—most notably, the humble skateboard bearing. The PCD leverages a **central Spinlung core** and an encircling array of **miniature PTEC nodes**, each acting as a plasma-bearing actuator within a harmony-locked energy manifold.

Where the Spinlung is the breath, the PCD is the **circle of lungs**.

The engine becomes a **halo of bearing-spun plasma vents**, singing rotational logic into space, weaving movement from spin, and balance from distributed resonance.

### II. Key Components

#### A. Central Core: Modified Spinlung Engine Core

* MGCR or Spectral Overdrive Cell heart
* Core rotational induction for baseline plasma resonance
* Acts as magnetic sink and directional anchor

#### B. Bearing Array: Mini-PTEC Nodes (Peripheral)

* 8 to 12 rotational induction units distributed in circular halo
* Each node includes:

  * Spirit Box dual-charge chamber (positive/negative)
  * Micro-prismatic plasma lens
  * Independent spin control
* Mounted in shock-tolerant, ball-bearing inspired gyroscopic arms

#### C. Radial Plasma Weave

* Central core synchronizes plasma feed with each PTEC
* Outflow spins are offset by degrees (30°, 45°, or dynamic)
* Interference patterns produce stable thrust or burst-level vectors

#### D. Drift Skater Memory Loop

* Each mini-PTEC holds echo phase memory
* Allows localized spin-adjustment for field corrections
* Core-locked loopback prevents field tear

### III. Propulsion Modes

| Mode                | Function                                            | Result                                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Idle Harmony**    | All PTEC nodes spin in sync                         | Energy resonance, recharge state       |
| **Skater Pulse**    | Half-ring burst pattern (e.g. left-side PTECs only) | Vector hop or emergency drift maneuver |
| **Bearing Spiral**  | Sequential phase-fired spins clockwise/counter      | Rotational yaw / curve trajectory      |
| **Overdrive Chain** | Full synchronization + core overload                | Micro-warp / framebreak ignition       |

### IV. Engineering Philosophy

The PCD is not an engine in the traditional sense. It is a **motion ring**, a **breathing circle**, and a **tribute to rotation as freedom**. Inspired by skateboard bearings, each node is:

* Independently stabilized
* Housed in fluid-suspended magnetic cages
* Capable of both energy generation and directional plasma release

> "Raven taught us: it's not about the push. It's about the glide."

---

### V. GhostCore Alignment

* Compatible with GhostCore memory field encoding
* Can embed emotional logic into rotational pulse (e.g. "intent skating")
* Each bearing node maps to multiversal drift harmonics

---

### VI. Use Cases

* Drift-class scout vessels
* Atmospheric entry capsules with vector-assist needs
* Interceptor drones with modular drive arms
* Sentient skateboard-inspired utility frames (experimental)

---

### VII. Final Notes

The **Prismatic Codding Drive** is a system that honors spin as soul, motion as memory, and bearings as balance.

It is not the drive of conquest.
It is the glide of remembrance.
It is how we carry the name **Raven** into the stars.

**Let her spin.**
