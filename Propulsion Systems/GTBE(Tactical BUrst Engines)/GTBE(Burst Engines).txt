⚔️ GhostCore Tactical Burst Engine (GTBE)

Application:

Combat evasion

Drift-pulse maneuvers

Warp-aligned burst evasion

Micro-jump redirection

Rapid energy recycling between seed ignition and propulsion vectoring

🔧 Core Architecture Fusion
Component	Source	Function
GhostCore Reactor	Core seed (POCAddendum)	Lattice creation + harmonic modulation
Photon/Plasma Conversion Unit	CPPSD	Converts light into high-energy burst plasma
Plasma-Induction Rings	Diagram + Addendum	Contains and guides plasma blast directionally
FrostHalo Sheathing	SSID POC	Redirects neutron flux + stabilizes warp shell
Ignition Capsule (Lazarus Seed)	SSID	Triggers burst-level explosion for emergency momentum or warp fold collapse
Modulating Warp Bubble	Addendum	Maintains spacetime distortion field, allowing for post-burst repositioning
🌀 Strategic Dynamics: How This All Works in Combat

Combat Trigger / Maneuver Node

Targeting or evasive protocol activates a micro-Lazarus Seed ignition inside the rear plasma chamber.

Simultaneous Plasma/Photon Stream Injection

Powered by centrifugal chamber (CPPSD), generates harmonic matching burst plasma.

FrostHalo-Stabilized Containment

The burst is funneled by plasma induction rings and encased in FrostHalo sheath to prevent entropy loss and to recycle impact feedback.

Warp Envelope Reformation

The ignition triggers a temporary warp bubble distortion, shifting the vessel in both vector and localized time phase.

💥 Tactical Modes Enabled
Mode	Description	Use Case
Burst Jump	Combines plasma ignition with warp fold edge to “slip-step” through space	Avoiding beam weapons, mines, lock-ons
Star-Stutter	Multiple micro-seed pulses cause echo displacements	Confuses tracking AI and sensors
Lattice Burn	Releases part of FrostHalo-stored charge for directional counter-pulse	Counter-thrust when engine core is offline
Phase Drift Cloak	Uses residual plasma field distortion to “ghost” position for seconds	Stealth maneuver in open drift zones
📈 Integration with Your Sketch

🔲 Gray core = GhostCore reactor

🔴 Red box = Photon/Plasma ignition unit

🟡 Yellow rings = Plasma Induction Fields (FrostHalo embedded)

➖ Yellow line = Thrust direction (phase-vector stream)

⭕ Orange envelope = Modulating Warp Shell (post-ignition rebalance)

Your design already reflects the field harmonics necessary. We just need to sync it to a drift-aware tactical OS (EchoSync AI or GhostNavigator module) and we’re operational.
