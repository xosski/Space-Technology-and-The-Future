### I. Abstract

The Plasma-Electric Vortex Drive (PEVD) is a short-to-medium range propulsion concept based on dynamic plasma channeling and dual-coil polarity inversion. Designed for agile fighter craft and orbital maneuvering vehicles, PEVD offers precise impulse thrust, directional reversals, and non-reactive drift capabilities within a confined operational envelope. While it lacks the high-efficiency of long-range ion drives, its rapid energy cycling, noble gas economy, and low thermal footprint make it ideal for inner-system engagements and fast-response vectoring.

### II. System Overview

The core of the PEVD is a dual helix coil architecture built around alternating current paths (blue and yellow spirals) surrounded by regulated noble gas channels. This configuration allows plasma to be cyclically ionized, compressed magnetically, and expelled through a directional thrust nozzle—producing electromagnetic thrust without conventional propellant.

### IV. Use Case Analysis

#### 🛰 **Drift Maneuvering**

PEVD excels at low-gravity inertia correction, using polarity-flipped coils to initiate smooth gliding through gravitational fields without exhaust trails.

#### 🚀 **Short-Range Interplanetary Travel**

By using stored plasma capacitor rounds, small vessels can traverse inner planetary orbits (e.g., Mars-to-Earth, Venus-to-Mercury) in weeks rather than months, ideal for scouting or tactical operations.

#### ⚔️ **Fighter-Class Mobility**

PEVD’s rapid inversion and high thrust burst make it effective for:

* Vector hopping
* Quick deceleration without rotation
* Outmaneuvering heavier engine signatures

#### 🚧 **Limitations**

* Not suitable for long-duration deep space voyages
* Plasma recharge cycles limit continuous thrusting
* Noble gas scarcity could limit battlefield endurance

### V. Tactical and Strategic Benefits

| Benefit                 | Application                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Silent Drift Mode**   | Coils maintain motion with no signature exhaust              |
| **EMP Resilience**      | Self-contained, reversible plasma channels buffer EM attacks |
| **Low Thermal Profile** | Ideal for stealth insertion in orbital zones                 |
| **Burst Acceleration**  | Short-range evasion or gap-closing strikes                   |

### VI. Future Work

* Optimize for **Hafnium-Tungsten hull integration**
* Merge with **Neon Genesis Armor** for ion-distributed shielding
* Simulate full-mass fighter drift loop with multiple coil banks
* Explore dark plasma variant for zero-emission stealth cruising

**Conclusion:**

While PEVD will not replace long-range fusion or gravitic drives, it fills a critical role: agile, reusable, and directional impulse for ships that **need to be seen, disappear, or strike without delay**. It is the language of movement written in twisted light.
