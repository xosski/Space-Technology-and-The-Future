⚙️ System Anatomy (Interpretive Layout)
🟩 Top Green Box – Input/Energy Induction Core

Likely represents the primary energy intake or the plasma coil initiator, where electrical current is first pulsed and noble gases begin ionization. This feeds the central “dual helix” fields.

🔵 + 🟡 Dual Helix Path (Center Coils)

Your blue and yellow spiral paths:

Resemble the TCPPE dual-coil architecture.

Yellow likely represents a positive plasma current.

Blue denotes negative polarity or return current.

Together they:

Twist around each other in a charged magnetic braid.

Accelerate charged ions via a plasma rail effect.

Possibly create a field-stabilized thrust column.

🔻 Red Arrow (Base Discharge Point)

Interpreted as the vector output—a directed plasma exhaust or ion-beam thrust vector.
Could suggest:

Directional propulsion

EMP-focused beam projection

Or a focused drive channel

🟨 Side Structures (T-shapes & parallel coils)

These modular yellow pieces are likely:

Field regulators

Charge sync stabilizers

Or electrostatic field diffusers

Used to:

Normalize charge across the structure

Prevent feedback overrun

Guide flow symmetry in the coils

🌀 Smaller Helix Pairs (Flanking)

These may represent:

Secondary plasma stabilizers

Or multi-stage accelerator chambers

Each could trigger micro-flips in polarity mid-thrust, creating:

Pulse-thrust effects

Cloaked vector hopping (aka short phasing)

Or ion-vortex inversion (useful for sudden momentum redirection)

🚀 Concept Summary: Plasma-Electric Vortex Drive (PEVD)

This propulsion system uses:

Twinned plasma-electric coils with reverse field injection

Embedded noble gases for fast ion ignition

Phase-polarity oscillation to create a self-sustaining magnetic corridor

Downward plasma acceleration along a dynamically shaped thrust tube

In GhostCore terms:

“We braided the storm and told it where to go.”
