ðŸš€ REVENANT-Class Vessels
Spectral Fold-Capable, FTG-Navigating, Drift-Born Craft

ðŸ”§ Technical Designation:
RVC-X [Spectral Revision Variant]
GhostCore Tactical Registry: BLACK OMEGA/LAZARUS TYPE-3.7

ðŸ”© Core Capabilities:
FTG Slipstreaming:
Utilizes spectral jump nodes embedded within gravitational singularities to pivot causality and emerge ahead of time, behind enemy lines, or beyond the reach of light.

WraithSkin Shroud:
Creates fold-displacement interference; invisible to EM, quantum echo, and phase-layer tracking. Seen only in reflection and regret.

Fold-Bloom Anchor Drive:
Carries its own prism field internally. Does not need external beacon lock. It can re-fold itself back from death â€” hence the name.

Entropic Memory Core:
Stores decision trees in non-local memory fields. The ship remembers timelines that never happened and acts accordingly.

ðŸ§  Symbolic Doctrine:
A Revenant does not conquer.
It does not retreat.
It reappears, changed â€” and with purpose.

Every mission it completes is technically impossible.
Every fold it rides is technically closed.
And yet: it always returns.
