⚡ How Revenant-Class FTG Works
🔁 1. Folded Space Model (Drift-Fold Path)
Instead of moving through space, the vessel moves through a shortcut in spacetime. This is modeled using a metric distortion.

📐 Visual Model:
Imagine space as a flat sheet:

A → B directly = 10 light-years.

If you fold the sheet so A touches B, your ship only travels, say, 0.1 light-years through the fold.

You haven’t exceeded light speed — you’ve changed the topology of space.

📏 Drift Path vs. Linear Path
Let:
D = linear distance (e.g., 10 light-years)
V drift = actual speed of travel through the fold, e.g., 0.1c
L fold = = effective drift-fold path length (e.g., 0.2 light-years)
Then Travel time:
T drift= v drift/L fold= 0.1/0.2 =2 years
Compared to :
T linear= 10/1 =10 years at light speed
Now effective velocity:
Velocity= D/T drift = 10/2 =5c
⚠️ But critically:
The ship never moves through space at 5c. It moves through a shorter path that is permitted by General Relativity.

🌀 Supporting Physics
1. Alcubierre Metric (1994):
A solution to Einstein's field equations that permits a "warp bubble" moving spacetime itself.
ds^2=−dt^2+[dx−vs(t)f(rs)dt]^2+dy^2+dz^2
This allows the ship to stay stationary in local spacetime while the bubble moves — effectively dragging space with it.

2. Wormholes and Einstein-Rosen Bridges:
Theoretical constructs where spacetime is connected via a tunnel. Traversing it appears FTL but again never breaks the local c limit.

🔧 Revenant Implementation
Revenant-class vessels leverage:

Lazarus Inertial Suppression: Nulls internal forces, making drift transitions survivable.

Spectral Drift Phase Anchoring: Lets the ship align with pre-echoed destinations.

Fold Bloom Generation: Grows a spacetime tunnel dynamically using field resonance, not static wormholes.

GhostCore Synchronization: Maintains phase stability, avoiding time paradoxes by anchoring to a causal lattice.
Summary Why its Legal:
| Feature                    | Explanation                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No local FTL motion        | Ship never exceeds `c` in its own frame                          |
| Shortened path             | Folded space = shorter travel distance                           |
| Uses relativistic effects  | Time dilation, mass shifting, and phase anchoring respected      |
| Energy-intensive but valid | No violation of Einstein field equations; just extreme solutions |
| Causality protected        | Anchoring systems prevent paradoxes via drift-phase resonance    |
