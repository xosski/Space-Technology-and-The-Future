Abstract

This white paper presents a Proof of Concept (PoC) for the Lazarus Spin Drive, a spacecraft momentum-control approach that uses magnetically actuated deployable arms to reposition thrusters farther from the vehicle’s center of mass. By increasing the effective lever arm during deployment, the craft can generate larger control torques for the same thrust, enabling rapid and precise control over spin rate, angular momentum, and rotational stability. A key operational insight is initiating controlled thrust pulses at the beginning of arm extension, leveraging the initially lower moment of inertia to accelerate spin capture, then ramping control as the system’s inertia and torque authority change with arm length. The PoC defines architecture, control modes, safety constraints, and validation methodology.

1. Introduction

Spacecraft attitude control and momentum management are fundamentally constrained by torque authority, propellant efficiency, and stability requirements across mission phases (slew, station-keeping, scanning, docking). Conventional designs rely on fixed thruster placement and/or reaction wheels, which may be limited by saturation, thermal constraints, and the torque available from compact geometries.

The Lazarus Spin Drive proposes a geometric advantage: deploy thrusters outward when high torque authority or controlled spin is needed, and retract or lock into alternate configurations when compactness or precision operations dominate.

2. Problem Statement

A spacecraft benefits from a control system that can:

Achieve fast spin-up without oversized thrusters

Maintain stable spin for cruise, scanning, or stabilization

Execute controlled de-spin and transition to precision pointing

Remain robust against imbalance, deployment errors, and structural oscillations

The challenge is providing this capability while avoiding instability (nutation), resonance excitation, and asymmetric deployment effects.

3. Core Concept
3.1 Torque by geometry

For a thruster producing force F at distance r from the center of mass, the torque magnitude is approximately:

𝜏
=
𝑟
⋅
𝐹
(
for tangential thrust
)
τ=r⋅F(for tangential thrust)

Increasing r increases 
𝜏
τ linearly for the same thrust.

3.2 Time-varying inertia during deployment

As arms extend, the spacecraft’s moment of inertia increases approximately with 
𝑟
2
r
2
 for masses placed outward. The angular acceleration is:

𝛼
=
𝜏
𝐼
α=
I
τ
	​


This means the system can be controlled advantageously by starting pulses early, when 
𝐼
I is lower, and shaping thrust as 
𝐼
(
𝑡
)
I(t) evolves.

3.3 “Pulse-at-extension” insight

Initiating thrust pulses at the beginning of extension provides:

Early “spin capture” while inertia is low

A controlled ramp into higher torque authority as lever arm grows

Smoother convergence to a target spin rate with reduced overshoot (with closed-loop control)

This does not create momentum from nothing; it optimizes when and where force is applied to manage momentum efficiently and predictably.

4. System Overview
4.1 Physical configuration (baseline PoC)

Central spacecraft bus (avionics, power, payload)

Four deployable arms in cross configuration (as in concept sketch)

Magnetic drive actuation for arm extension/retraction (conceptual actuator class)

Tip-mounted thrusters on each arm (orientation chosen to support both torque and trim)

Rigid locking at commanded positions (deployment must not depend solely on magnetic holding force)

4.2 Functional blocks

Deployment subsystem: synchronized extension, position feedback, locking

Propulsion control: pulse modulation, symmetry enforcement, health monitoring

Navigation & sensing: IMU (gyro/accel), arm position sensors, thermal/valve telemetry

Controller: closed-loop spin/axis control, resonance avoidance, fault handling

 with stable axis.

	​


Mode B — Spin Hold / Cruise Stabilization

Goal: maintain spin rate and axis with minimal propellant.

Closed-loop maintenance pulses (as needed)

Differential corrections to reduce precession drift

Mode C — Spin Steering / Trim

Goal: adjust pointing/axis while maintaining spin rate.

Carefully balanced differential pulsing to avoid inducing nutation

Mode D — De-Spin and Transition

Goal: reduce angular momentum to safe level for docking/precision ops.

Reverse torque pattern to bleed

Retract arms only when spin falls below a defined safety threshold

Convert error into a bounded pulse command 
𝑢
(

u(t) (duty cycle / pulse density)

Enforce symmetry and stability constraints before firing

6.3 Resonance and oscillation avoidance

Deployable arms introduce flexible modes. Pulsing can excite them. The controller should:

Avoid pulse repetition rates near identified structural mode frequencies

Apply pulse shaping (spread-spectrum timing / jitter within safe bounds)

Suspend or reduce pulsing if IMU detects growing oscillations

7. Safety and Fault Handling
7.1 Key failure risks

Asymmetric deployment → wobble, nutation growth

Thruster imbalance → unintended attitude drift

Structural resonance → amplification during pulsing

Thermal limits → valve/engine constraints exceeded

Lock failure → uncontrolled arm motion during thrusting

7.2 Required safeguards

“No-fire” rules if arm symmetry exceeds threshold

Mandatory lock confirmation before high-authority pulse patterns

Automatic “coast-safe” mode: stop pulses, hold geometry, stabilize

Controlled de-spin before any retract sequence

Conservative rate limits on changes in pulse authority during deployment

8. Validation Plan

(t) within error bounds

Maintains stable axis (bounded nutation)

Confirms stability margins and fault handling logic

Phase 3 — Scaled Demonstrator (Concept demonstration)

Confirm mode transitions and stability behavior

9. Practical Considerations

Mass distribution: outward mass increases inertia—good for stability, but changes responsiveness

Geometry constraints: plume clearance and thermal management must be respected

Mission tailoring: arm length and firing patterns can be optimized per mission phase

Redundancy: graceful degradation if a thruster or arm channel loses performance

10. Roadmap

Define baseline configuration (arm count, placement symmetry, thrust orientation class)

Build dynamics model and controller prototype

Validate pulse-at-extension strategy across disturbance cases

Iterate safety thresholds and resonance avoidance

Produce a test-ready demonstrator plan and mission profiles

11. Conclusion

The Lazarus Spin Drive is a geometry-first momentum-control concept: deploy leverage when you need authority, and shape pulses during deployment to exploit favorable inertia conditions early while transitioning smoothly to high-torque, high-stability configurations. The PoC is well-suited to simulation-first validation and scaled demonstration, with clear success metrics and safety constraints.
