What you gain (physics, clean and brutal)

Torque: 
𝜏
=
𝑟
⋅
𝐹
τ=r⋅F (when thrust is tangent). Bigger 
𝑟
r = bigger torque for the same thruster.

Spin-up rate: 
𝛼
=
𝜏
/
𝐼
α=τ/I. During extension, your moment of inertia 
𝐼
(
𝑡
)
I(t) increases roughly like 
𝑟
2
r
2
. So you’re trading:

More leverage (good)

More inertia (also good for stability, but it slows acceleration)

That’s why your “start pulsing at the beginning of extension” idea is real: early on, 
𝐼
I is smaller, so even modest torque can kick the craft into rotation quickly. As the arms extend, you ramp thrust to keep 
𝛼
α where you want it.

The control trick that makes it feel like “free thrust” (but isn’t)

You’re not creating extra momentum from nowhere—you’re shaping when and where force is applied:

Early extension: small 
𝑟
r, small torque, but very low inertia, so you get noticeable angular acceleration.

Mid/late extension: larger 
𝑟
r, torque climbs, inertia climbs—you ramp duty cycle to hit a target spin-rate smoothly.

Net effect: you get fast controllable spin-up without huge thrusters, plus a stable high-
𝐼
I spinning configuration once deployed.

How to architect “Lazarus Spin Drive” so it’s controllable, not a tumble machine

1) Hardware layout

4 extendable arms (your drawing) with:

A magnetic linear actuator (think: linear motor / voice-coil style drive) or a motor+screw if you want simpler.

Hard locks at deployed length (don’t rely on magnets to hold structure under thrust loads).

Thrusters on tips oriented so you can generate:

Pure spin torque (opposing pairs fire tangentially)

Pure translation (all fire aligned through center-of-mass direction)

Attitude trim (single-arm or differential firing)

2) Pulse schedule during extension

Start with low duty cycle pulses immediately (to “catch” a stable spin axis).

As arm length increases, increase pulse duty cycle to hold a desired angular acceleration or spin-rate.

A simple control law:

Measure spin rate 
𝜔
ω (IMU/gyro).

Define a target profile

3) Momentum control modes

Spin-Up Mode: deploy + pulse to reach target 
𝜔
ω

Hold Mode: minimal pulses to maintain 
𝜔
ω (or coast if you can)

Steer Mode: tiny differential pulses for pointing changes while spinning

De-Spin Mode: reverse pulse pattern to bleed angular momentum before docking/precision ops

The “gotchas” you’ll want to design around

Asymmetric deployment = instant bad day. If one arm lags, you get wobble/nutation. Fix: synchronized deployment + continuous balancing logic.

Structural resonance. Extending booms while pulsing thrusters can excite bending modes. Fix: avoid pulse frequencies near measured modes; ramp smoothly.

Plume impingement & contamination. Tip thrusters can cook your own structure depending on geometry. Fix: keep plumes clear of arms/body, or cant thrusters outward slightly.

Magnetic drives don’t magically push on space. They’re great for deployment actuation, not for propellantless thrust (unless you’re specifically using Earth’s magnetic field via magnetorquers, which is a different system and weak).

The one-line “why this is cool”

You’re building a craft that can change its torque leverage on demand, so it can go from compact → agile spin control → high-stability spinning configuration, all under closed-loop authority.

If you want, I can turn this into a tight PoC-style writeup (mission profile + modes + block diagram + key equations), and keep it “institution-ready” without any build-step specifics.

Proof of Concept
Lazarus Spin Drive

Deployable Magnetic-Actuated Thruster Arms for High-Authority Spacecraft Momentum Control

Version: PoC v0.1
Status: Concept validation / architecture definition
Author: Ghost (concept origin)

1) Executive Summary

The Lazarus Spin Drive is a spacecraft attitude and momentum-control concept that uses magnetically actuated deployable arms to extend thrusters outward from the vehicle’s centerline. By increasing the lever arm during deployment, the craft can generate substantially higher torque for the same thrust. If thruster pulses begin at the start of extension, the system can achieve rapid, controllable spin-up and then transition into a high-stability configuration once fully deployed.

This is not “free thrust”—it’s smart timing and geometry: shaping when force is applied while the vehicle’s moment of inertia changes, enabling faster response early and stronger torque authority later.

2) Objective

Demonstrate that a spacecraft can achieve:

Fast spin-up and precise spin-rate control using deployable thruster arms

Improved rotational authority without oversized thrusters

Stable high-inertia spin state for cruise, stabilization, scanning, or field operations

Controlled de-spin for docking, landing, or precision pointing

3) Concept Overview
Core idea

Extend thrusters outward using magnetic drive actuation so that:

Torque increases with radius:

𝜏
=
𝑟
⋅
𝐹
  
  
(
tangential thrust
)
τ=r⋅F(tangential thrust)

Starting pulses early matters because initial inertia is lower; as arms extend, both leverage and inertia change, so the system ramps pulse duty-cycle to hit target spin behavior smoothly.

What the system controls

Angular momentum (spin-up / spin-down)

Attitude steering while spinning (trim, pointing, stabilization)

Momentum management (avoid wobble, keep axis stable, reduce nutation)

4) System Architecture
4.1 Mechanical layout (baseline)

Central spacecraft bus (mass, power, avionics)

4 deployable arms arranged in a cross (your sketch)

Arms extend via magnetic drive actuation (linear motor / magnetic coupling concept) and lock rigidly at set lengths

Thruster at each arm tip, mounted to allow both:

Tangential firing for spin torque

Symmetric firing for translation or trim (depending on vehicle needs)

4.2 Sensing and feedback

IMU (gyro/accelerometer) for 
𝜔
ω (spin rate), axis stability, and oscillation detection

Arm position sensors (extension length, sync)

Thruster health monitoring (valves, temperature, duty cycle)

4.3 Control computer

Runs the closed-loop controller that:

Synchronizes deployment

Schedules pulse patterns

Maintains target spin rate and axis

Detects instability (wobble / resonance) and corrects or aborts

5) Operating Modes
Mode A — Spin-Up + Deploy (primary signature mode)

Begin extending arms in sync

Start low-duty pulses immediately to “capture” a clean axis

Ramp duty cycle as radius increases to track target spin profile

Reach target spin rate at or near full extension

Why it works: early acceleration while inertia is lower, then increasing torque authority as the lever arm grows.

Mode B — Spin Hold (Cruise Stabilization)

Arms locked deployed

Minimal pulses (or none if feasible) to maintain 
𝜔
ω and suppress drift

Differential micro-pulses to correct axis precession

Mode C — Spin Steering / Trim

Maintain spin rate while nudging pointing vector

Uses controlled differential firings to avoid inducing nutation

Mode D — De-Spin + Retract

Reverse torque pulse pattern to reduce 
𝜔
ω

Retract arms only once spin is below a safe threshold

Transition to standard attitude control or docking configuration

Pulse scheduling principle

Early extension: low inertia → small pulses create noticeable response

Mid/late extension: larger lever arm → torque authority increases, but inertia also rises → controller ramps appropriately

Resonance avoidance: controller rejects pulse frequencies that excite arm flex modes

7) Safety Constraints and Fail-Safes

Hard requirements (PoC assumptions):

Synchronized extension across all arms (asymmetry can cause wobble)

Rigid locking at commanded lengths (don’t rely on “magnet hold” alone)

Instability detection: abort pulses if nutation grows beyond threshold

Thermal & duty constraints: thrusters remain within limits

Safe retract rules: do not retract at high spin rates

Fail-safe behaviors:

Stop pulsing → coast

Revert to minimal stabilization pulses

Lock arms in place until stable

If needed, execute controlled de-spin before any mechanical reconfiguration

8) Validation Plan (What “success” looks like)
Phase 1 — Simulation (first win)

	​

 with low overshoot

Robustness tests: small arm lag, thruster imbalance, sensor noise

Success criteria: stable spin-up, stable axis, recoverable from minor faults.

Phase 2 — Hardware-in-the-loop (controller proof)

Controller runs real-time against a simulated plant

Confirms pulse scheduling and safety logic

Phase 3 — Prototype demonstration (scaled)

Bench/air-bearing table or equivalent demonstrator

Verify sync extension + pulse torque control produces commanded spin behaviors

9) Risks and Mitigations

Arm asymmetry → wobble/nutation → mitigate with strict sync control + abort logic

Structural resonance excited by pulses → mitigate via resonance mapping + pulse shaping

Plume interaction / contamination → mitigate via thruster cant angles and layout clearance

Controller instability → mitigate with conservative gains and staged mode transitions

Mechanical lock failure → mitigate with redundant locks and sensor confirmation
