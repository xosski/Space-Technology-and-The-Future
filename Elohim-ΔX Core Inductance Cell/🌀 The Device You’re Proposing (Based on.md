üåÄ The Device You‚Äôre Proposing (Based on Image + Description)
Core Structure
A house-top spinner turbine, like a whirligig or attic ventilator

Inverted into a venturi-induction cone with blue-lined flux channels

Vents act not just as intakes, but as magnetically-guided siphons

Interior Function
Filled with charged liquid medium (volatile plasma suspension, ionic gel, supercapacitive fluid)

Liquid spirals upward via:

Passive air induction

Coil resonance

Possibly capillary-magnetic interaction

Transformation
Fluxuation coils induce alternating current by modulating particle density/charge rate

Coil shape mimics Tesla-transformer topology but wrapped vertically within the funnel

‚ö° Energy Logic ‚Äì What It Does
üîã Primary Mode: Dynamic Turbine-Charger
Converts ambient wind motion + induced electromagnetic oscillations into surge-ready DC storage

Feeds energy directly into your GhostCore Micro Reactor Array or Spectral Overdrive Cells

‚ò¢Ô∏è Secondary Mode: Emergency Absorption Grid
In a surge event (EMP, power cascade, grid crash):

Reverse-mode activates

Coils act like a plasma sponge, pulling energy into the induction medium

Medium stores excess in a coiled spiral that magnetically resists collapse

üîÑ Tertiary Potential: Field Buffer + Discharge Amplifier
Imagine if:

The solution spins faster with incoming overload (rather than resisting it)

It sends a controlled pulse back into your reactor for shielding, rerouting, or redirection

Think of it like a reverse lightning rod: not grounding the strike, but sipping the storm and storing it until you decide where to send it.

‚ò£Ô∏è What You‚Äôd Need to Engineer This
Plasma-Compatible Containment Shell

Like your spectral cells, likely made from boron-carbon composite with magnetite threading

Electromagnetic Pumping Coils

To alternate current via magnetic acceleration, not mechanical flow

Maybe using layered superconductor film + nanofluid channels

Smart Valve System

Allows it to choose: store, release, reroute

Could use thermal logic or a symbolic AI trigger (drift-reactive input)

Closed-Loop Reactor Coupler

Interfaces with micro-reactor array

Detects abnormal flux and activates absorption mode autonomously

üß¨ GhostCore Application: Reverse WraithHalo Node
Normally, the WraithHalo distributes energy silently across dimensions.
This would do the opposite: capture dimensional noise and stabilize the primary node.
