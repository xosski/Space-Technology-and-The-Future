ü©ª PORS Addendum: WRAITH-BIND Protocol v0.7.Œ≥
Autonomous Limb Stabilization & Synthetic Tissue Reconstitution Layer
üîß SYSTEM MOD: Removal of Stem Cell Dependency
Replaced With:
SCR-AAV: Synthetic Cellular Rebirth Adeno-Associated Viral suite (see: [28‚Ä†SyntheticStemCellsandRebirth.txt])
LAMINA Sync: Engineered nerve remapping and live relay injection (see: [29‚Ä†GhostCore Lamina POC.txt])
Bioholographic Regrowth Agents: AI-resonant genomic patch emitters using local cell data (see: [27‚Ä†CellNecrosis.txt])

üß¨ FRACTURE + REGENERATION SYSTEM WORKFLOW
**When activated by break or trauma, the biosuit executes a 5-tier protocol to immediately stabilize, reconfigure, and reconstruct:

1. ‚ö° Fracture Detection + Lockdown
Mesh senses kinetic spike and subcutaneous instability

Photonic lattice tightens into geo-anchored prism web

Radiation-hardened nodes form internal splint, conforming perfectly to fracture map

2. üß† Neural Integrity Shielding
LAMINA Bypass Injection begins immediately

AAV-encoded light logic channels route through disrupted nerve pathways

Microbot relay swarm aligns axonal fragments, preventing misfire/miswiring

3. üß™ Synthetic Cellular Rebirth (SCR Mode)
DAMP-detecting AAV-GhostCore-NX1 and RV2 vectors are released locally

Neighboring viable cells scanned ‚Üí DNA templates mirrored ‚Üí synthetic cells reconstructed

No stem cells. No harvest. Just engineered cellular memory recovery.

4. üí° Time-Zero Regrowth
Reconstructed cells initiated while fracture is still fresh

Prevents scar tissue establishment

Ensures all regrown cells align with original positional and electrophysiological memory

5. üß© GhostCore Pattern Echo Binding
Each newly built cell receives signal resonance seeding

Optogenetic opsins & quorum-linked synchronizers ensure bio-behavioral alignment

What‚Äôs reborn isn‚Äôt just structure ‚Äî it‚Äôs function

üõ° MATERIAL INTEGRATION
Prism-Reactive Alloys:
Radiation-hardened Manganese-Titanium Silicates

Harden upon targeted photonic exposure

Allow pressure micro-pulsing for adaptive rigidity

Can be locally annealed or disassembled on-demand

Internal Lattice Seeding:
Rather than external carbon-fiber casts, the lattice becomes the scaffold

Activated crystal memory matches wearer‚Äôs unique skeletal topography

This is not bracing ‚Äî this is remembering the limb from the inside out

‚ö†Ô∏è DESIGN PHILOSOPHY SHIFT
‚ÄúYou do not stop the break. You speak to it.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou do not wait to regrow. You rebuild while it still remembers what it was.‚Äù

üì¶ TECH COMPOSITE
Layer	Technology Used	Purpose
Lockdown Mesh	Prism lattice + MnTi radiation hardening	Instant splint + pressure dispersion
Nerve Relay	AAV9 + Anc80 light-logic delivery	Nerve bridging, opsin tuning
Regenerative Vector	SCR AAV-GhostCore NX1 + RV2 + LZ3	DNA/membrane/organelle rebuilding
Scar Inhibition	Anti-fibrotic exosomes + immune cloaking	Prevents glial barrier, allows full integration
Behavioral Alignment	Quorum-sensing modules + pattern echo filters	Prevents rogue growth, ensures network fidelity

‚öô Deployment Trigger
Auto-deploy: Upon skeletal disjunction or nerve snap

Manual override: 3-point flex + breath spike signal

Recovery Duration (v0.7): ~3 minutes to complete mesh hardening + SCR initiation

Optional cooldown: decompression wave to reduce thermal load post-annealing
