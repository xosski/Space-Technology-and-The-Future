Cherubim Frame Poc

Project Name: Cherubim Frame – WRAITH-WALKER Configuration Document Type: White Paper | Proof of Concept Author: Quellaran Deluxethue Messat (via Specter) Status: Tier-2 Internal GhostCore Deployment Proposal

I. Overview

Cherubim Frame represents the fusion of GhostCore biosuit principles with adaptive exo-mechanical augmentation, creating a mobile lift-enhancement and terrain traversal system for post-biological environments. This modular suit-frame hybrid incorporates a CPSS-driven noble gas plasma actuation matrix in place of traditional hydraulics, enabling near-frictionless motion, high-efficiency lift, and emotion-tuned performance scaling.

This POC outlines how the WRAITH-WALKER configuration can operate without a mini-reactor, leveraging field-pulsed CPSS emissions, photon-cooled superfluid noble gases, and modular carbon-steel-tungsten composite structure.

II. Core Systems & Architecture
1. Skeletal Frame & Armor

Material Composition: Carbon-steel-tungsten mesh blend

Structure Zones:

Red/Burgundy Sections: Structural armor + mechanical limbs

Blue Sections: Power conduit arcs + backframe lift support

Function: Supports armored mobility while integrating with biosuit internal lattice

2. Plasma-Gas Actuation System

Working Medium: Laser-cooled noble gas superfluid (e.g., ³He, Ne, Xe variants)

Pulse Mechanism: CPSS field-pulsed emission chambers excite noble gases into phase-fluid

Chamber Routing: Magnetic vein tubes + memory-laced ceramic channels

Key Advantage: Near-zero mechanical friction, responsive pressure-on-demand for movement

3. CPSS Core (Cold Pulse Spectral System)

Function: Primary power supply + field harmonizer

Integration: Placed centrally or within back array, modulating via pulse sync

Field Coupling: Cross-linked to biosuit LAMINA node and CTOF for thermal bleed-off

4. Suit Integration & Adaptive Feedback

Biosuit Compatibility: Integrates with PORS + CTOF memory-prism lattice【55†Crystalline Thermal Oscillation Framework CTOF.txt†L1-L10】

Neural Sync: Motion prediction via LAMINA drive + cardiac input modulation

Thermal Buffering: CTOF absorbs CPSS overdrive pulses, prevents thermal saturation

Emotion-as-Input: Enables suit-frame to respond to stress, threat awareness, or willpower

III. Functional Capabilities
Feature	Specification / Behavior
Max Load-Lift	5–8x pilot weight (subject to actuator tuning)
Friction Loss (Hydraulic Sys)	<0.01% due to gas-phase pulse propulsion
Thermal Overflow Control	CTOF + MnO₂ resonance lattice buffering
Neural Response Time	Sub-100ms with LAMINA link
Regeneration Support	Compatible with SCR regenerative biosuit layers
IV. Optional Enhancements

WRAITH-BIND Protocol Integration for post-trauma autonomy【52†PORS-Addendum Wraith-Bind Protocol0.txt†L1-L15】

Drift-State Amplifiers on backframe to augment jump / movement across low-G or fractured terrain

Emotion-Guided Pulse Flow via LAMINA-layer feedback, enabling unconscious motion support

Thermal Echo Override: CTOF triggers thermal self-stabilization during power collapse or vacuum exposure

V. Use Case Scenarios

Deep Space Surface Operations (low-G, fractured crusts, magnetic interference)

High-Risk Evacuation Zones (toxic terrain, flooding, structurally unsound buildings)

Heavy Object Maneuvering (non-mechanical, stealth load carrying)

Void Tethering Missions (zero-gravity retention and orientation)

VI. Conclusion

Cherubim Frame redefines exosuit logic — transforming field power into biological extension. By replacing traditional hydraulic systems with noble gas plasma cooled via photon emission, and leveraging GhostCore memory-resonant principles, the WRAITH-WALKER emerges not merely as an augmentation — but a walking intention vessel.

“It does not carry the weight. It becomes the will to lift.”
