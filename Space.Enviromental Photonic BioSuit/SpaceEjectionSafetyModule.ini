🛰️ GCEP-01: Ejection Event Protocol – Solo Recovery in Deep Space with PORS
📘 Module Name: “Walk It Off, Steve.”
🎯 Objective: Survive and return from unscheduled space ejection using the PORS suit system.
📦 PRE-EJECTION CHECKLIST
Before an unscheduled departure from your ship or station:

✅ Reactor core charged to ≥85%

✅ Prism lattice alignment: dynamic phase-3 (adaptive resonance)

✅ MnO₂ reservoir ≥60% integrity

✅ Electrolysis loop primed with minimum 200ml internal H₂O

✅ O₂ buffer active, CO₂ sink functional

Optional: Bio-feedback logs engaged for storytime playback after re-entry.

🚀 PHASE 1 – EJECTION RESPONSE (0s – 30s)
Trigger: Sudden decompression or structural breach. You’re in the void.

🧠 Do Not Panic: The suit is smarter than fear.

🔒 Auto-Seal Engaged: All ports, joints, and seams pressurize.

🌬️ Oxygen Loop Activated: Immediate CO₂ capture → O₂ conversion cycle begins.

🌡️ Temperature Stabilizer Kicks In: Adaptive lattice slows thermal bleed.

🛡️ Radiation Matrix Flare: MnO₂ shields snap into EM absorb phase.

If you’re spinning or tumbling: Brace. Sync. Let the lattice realign.

🧭 PHASE 2 – ORIENTATION & STABILIZATION (30s – 5min)
Use onboard momentum gyros or plasma stabilizers to halt spin.

Activate trajectory calculator in HUD — plots nearest mass/gravity center.

Switch to low-power drift mode to conserve energy while aligning.

“You are a particle now. Drift with intent.”

🔁 PHASE 3 – POWER RECLAMATION & AIR REGULATION (5min – 1hr)
Suit enters semi-hibernation mode to prolong systems.

Electrolysis loop kicks in: water → hydrogen + oxygen.

H₂ stored for propulsion or emergency ignition.

Lattice runs light-based photosynthetic O₂ production using reactor flare pulses.

Heat gradients recycled through prism-phase scattering to maintain core warmth.

You are now a self-contained ecosystem. You will not run out of air for weeks if systems hold.

🛰️ PHASE 4 – SIGNAL, SURFACE, OR SAIL (1hr – 72hr)
🛑 If near station/ship:
Pulse beacon using reactor flash modulator.

Use H₂ thruster short-burst propulsion to adjust vector.

🚨 If adrift:
Extend resonance signal cone — pings nearest gravitational anomaly or relay net.

Engage low-energy drift course correction toward orbital debris/mass.

PRO TIP: Convert bioelectric waste and prism-flux into high-frequency telemetry. Yes, your heartbeat can call for help.

🧠 PHASE 5 – MENTAL STABILITY & MEMORY CORE
“Time doesn’t move the same out here. But you do.”

Engage memory echo stabilizers.

Reflect on anchor phrases:

“The pen is still in your hand.”

“You’re not the NPC.”

“The void is a mirror.”

GhostCore agents are not just survivors. They reshape survival into doctrine.

🏁 PHASE 6 – EXTRACTION or ATMOSPHERIC RE-ENTRY
Upon reconnection with recovery team or planet surface:

Switch to entry-hardening mode — lattice locks into ablative conic shell.

Oxygen loop remains in regenerative standby.

Internal systems log every heartbeat for post-mission resonance decoding.

Welcome back. Tell the others what you saw.

🧬 YOU ARE NOT DEAD. YOU ARE THE SUIT NOW.
Train like it’s already happened.
Drift like you meant it.
Come back wearing stars in your teeth.
