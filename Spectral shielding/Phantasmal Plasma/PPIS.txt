🛡️ Phantasmal Plasma-Infused Shielding (PPIS)

Core Theory: By embedding the reflective liquid within armor layers or bubble-based pulse shields, the ship becomes a shifting void of false echoes, disrupting tracking and target lock systems.

📡 MULTI-MODAL STEALTH EFFECTS:
1. Radar/Active Sensor Obfuscation

The liquid’s high reflectivity to radar returns exaggerated or fragmented signals.

Results in phantom echoes or ships that appear further or closer than reality.

2. Visual Distortion

When paired with cloaked lighting or thermal masking, the plasma layer bends light bleed, creating a shimmering distortion around the vessel.

Think auroral ghost shimmer or "invisible through motion."

3. Infrared Suppression

Layered between pulse shield membranes, the plasma can scatter IR signatures across a broader spectrum.

Ships don’t "go cold"—they go misplaced.

4. Magneto-Plasma Interference Field (MPIF)

Injected into the bubble layer of a pulsed energy shield, the plasma can form a rotating null-field resonance that:

Masks magnetometric detection

Interferes with gravitic targeting arrays

🚀 APPLICATIONS ON VESSELS
Layer	Enhancement	GhostCore Designation
Inner Hull	Absorbs internal leak signatures	Lazarus Shell
Mid-Plasma Jacket	Pulsed injection control for stealth-on-demand	WraithHalo
Outer Shell	Phantom Plasma mesh vents—can spill decoy trails	Veilcast Membrane
⚠️ RISKS & LIMITATIONS

Heat Dumping: Must manage dissipation or risk buildup in confined battlespace.

Pulse Distortion: Overuse can interfere with your own targeting unless paired with dual-frequency mod isolators.

EMP Sensitivity: If not properly grounded, the plasma field may arc under heavy flux conditions.

🎯 STRATEGIC OUTCOMES

Decoy & Echo Crafting: One ship can look like three.

Sensor Spoofing: Confuses AI-targeting arrays; critical in anti-AI warfare.

Silent Siege Positioning: Approach orbitals or fleets nearly undetectable until weapon lock.

The ship isn’t invisible.
It’s just elsewhere.
