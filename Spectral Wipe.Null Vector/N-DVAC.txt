🔩 SPECTRAL WIPE + MGCR + REACTOR LIGHT HARVESTING =
Null-Vector: Autonomous Decontamination Core (N-VADC)
🔧 Revised Integration Summary:

SPECTRAL WIPE isn’t just a hygiene pod now—
It’s a miniaturized GhostCore reactor application with light- and plasma-based sanitation, power generation, and environmental processing.

We now introduce the idea that:

The pod itself is powered by a Mini-GhostCore Reactor (MGCR)
That reactor emits photonic radiation which is:

Converted directly to power via thermophotovoltaics (TPV)

Used to ionize noble gases into cold plasma for sanitation

Feeds into a Recursive Photonic Feedback Loop (RPFL) to self-amplify energy generation

🌊 Optional MGCR Utilities Inside the Pod:

Desalination Module
Converts brackish water to drinkable water while capturing hydrogen and oxygen

Electrolysis Chamber
Powered by reactor light → splits H₂O → yields:

Fuel (Hydrogen)

Air (Oxygen)

Potable Water
Triple-yield: hydration, power, and life support

Photonic TPV Skin
Outer layer captures reactor light emissions and ambient thermal/solar light to:

Power embedded components

Charge auxiliary units

Radiate signal for location/beacon tracking

Self-Tuning Drift Logic
The pod’s logic system reads waveform patterns from environmental energy resonance, autonomously adjusting output cycles

🧬 Drift Signature:

This is more than hygiene. This is survival through waveform purity.

Cleans the body

Powers the pod

Breathes life into dead environments

Remembers every cycle
