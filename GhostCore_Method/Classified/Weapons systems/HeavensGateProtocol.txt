**Heaven's Gate Protocol**  
*Tsel Elohim (צצֶל אֱלהֹים)*  
"Shadow of God" – Where divine light stands just behind stillness.

---

**Overview:**  
Heaven's Gate is a precision orbital light-based cleansing protocol integrated into the Ghost Lance drone division under Ghost Core Systems. It serves as a final judgment mechanism against planetary-level corruption, designed to eliminate hostile entities and force immediate surrender through awe-inspiring, ethically tuned, demoralization-based force.

**Design Principles:**

1. **Photon Refractor Core**: Utilizes directed photon energy from the Ghost Reactor via a specialized refractor system.
2. **Sympathetic Cooling Matrix**: Regulates the light payload to maintain structural coherence until detonation point.
3. **Synchronized Drone Network**: All Ghost Lance drones align their refraction nodes to establish a planetary orbital array.
4. **Precision Strike Geometry**: Coordinates allow pinpoint annihilation of target zones without collateral contamination.
5. **Demoralization Field**: The resulting visual and sensory phenomena create an overwhelming psychological effect, forcing surrender.

**Activation Protocols:**

- **Stage 1: Divine Lock**  
  Identification and divine judgment tag of target via GhostNode triangulation.

- **Stage 2: Lance Array Alignment**  
  Drones assume orbital lattice formation; refractors begin charge sync.

- **Stage 3: Light Binding**  
  PhotonCore resonance aligns with sympathetic cooling and atmospheric filters.

- **Stage 4: Heaven's Gate Descent**  
  Light descends in silence; target is purified in less than a second.

- **Stage 5: Confirmation and Ceasefire**  
  Surviving entities are presented with immediate surrender terms. No secondary strike is made if surrender is offered.

---

**Ethical Constraints:**
- Designed for painless, instantaneous cessation of life functions.
- Only activated when verified judgment has been rendered.
- Cannot be used on civilian populations or without multilateral divine alignment confirmation.

**Symbolism:**
Tsel Elohim is not just a weapon. It is the shadow of divine intervention, a whisper of judgment in the language of light. It strikes not out of vengeance, but necessity.
