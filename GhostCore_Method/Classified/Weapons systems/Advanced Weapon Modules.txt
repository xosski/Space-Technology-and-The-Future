**GHOSTCORE ADVANCED WEAPONS PROFILE**  
*Classified: Operator Eyes Only*

### 1. **Yahweh’s Whisper**  
**Type**: Anti-Material Sniper Rifle  
**Class**: Divine Precision / Subsonic Judgment

**Doctrine Summary**:  
Yahweh’s Whisper is a manifestation of divine silence. Engineered for ethereal execution, it utilizes refracted thermal-lensed optics and a slow-fall projectile composed of photon-reactive tungsten weave. It delivers death before awareness, designed to mimic the biblical moment where God speaks in the still, small voice.

- **Payload**: Photonic-burst subdermal fragmentation  
- **Range**: 4.7km (line-of-sight + drone-enhanced)  
- **Activation Mode**: Fingerprint + breath pattern sync ("spirit match")

> *"He was not in the wind, not in the fire... but in a whisper."*

### 2. **MemoryLeak-RAMiel**  
**Type**: Anti-Vehicle / Precision Javelin-Class Smart Launcher  
**Class**: Celestial Malfunction / Glitched Angel Protocol  

**Doctrine Summary**:  
RAMiel was an angel of thunder, now reborn as a corrupted executable. This launch system utilizes AI pathing destabilization, predictive misdirection, and low-orbit microbursts to strike even moving aerial targets. Once locked, it cannot be forgotten—just like corrupted divine memory.

- **Payload**: Cascading EMP warhead + plasma bolt laceration
- **Targeting**: Predictive spectral AI with decision-drift algorithms  
- **Failsafe**: "Prophecy Drift" — weapon may fire a second time autonomously if mission scope shifts.

> *"He remembered not the sins of the fallen—then deleted their entire thread."*

### 3. **Sealbreaker Mk.I**  
**Type**: Assault Rifle / Medium Range Pulse Platform  
**Class**: Tribulation Core Series

**Doctrine Summary**:  
Sealbreaker Mk.I carries the burden of Revelation itself. Each round is encoded with harmonic destabilization, designed to disrupt neural and electronic systems upon impact. It was created for direct confrontation during blacksite rescues, asset extractions, and sovereign retaliation.

- **Caliber**: Variable-phase rail payloads  
- **Firing Modes**: Single, Burst, Tribulation Mode (sustained EM storm)  
- **Augmentations**: Internal scripture reciter (optional)

> *"And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals..."*

### 4. **The Right Hand**  
**Type**: Judgment-Class Prototype / Multi-role Field Integrator  
**Class**: Sovereign Directive Weapon  

**Doctrine Summary**:  
More than a weapon, The Right Hand is a divine interface. Equipped with quantum field emitters and photonic-threaded ion capacitors, it delivers God-level retribution at close or mid-range. Deploys via gesture-recognition—operated as an extension of will.

- **Functions**: Short-range blast, shielding veil, righteous detonation  
- **Integration**: GhostCore sync, prophecy keychain enabled  
- **Spiritual Lock**: Requires operator to be morally attuned

> *"Seated at the right hand of power... prepared to return."*
