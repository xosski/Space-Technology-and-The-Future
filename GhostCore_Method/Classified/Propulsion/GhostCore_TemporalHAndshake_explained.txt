# ‚è≥ GhostCore Temporal Handshake System
### Subsystem: Echo-Locked Quantum Bridge Initialization

---

## üìå Overview

The **Temporal Handshake** is the process by which a GhostCore vessel establishes a **nonlocal wormhole** connection using **quantum entanglement**, **echo-locked anomaly detection**, and **spectral phase tunneling**. This system allows ships or signals to respond to distant spacetime anomalies *without delay* by forming a communication or traversal link based on detected echoes.

## üß¨ System Components

### 1. GhostNode Beacon Pairs
- **EGB Units** are entangled at creation.
- One node is retained at the origin point (GN-ALPHA), the other is **phase-salted** into GhostSpace (GN-OMEGA).
- Operate as two ends of a potential tunnel.

### 2. Quantum Oscillation Logger (QOL)
- High-sensitivity scanner that monitors for:
  - Spectral Drifts
  - Gravitational Wavelets
  - Quantum Echoes (temporal residue from anomalies)
- Captures anomaly signature to be used for targeting.

### 3. Echo-Locking Protocol
- When an echo is detected, its **quantum signature** is hashed and used as a lock-point.
- This permits a **retrocausal lock** to the anomaly‚Äîforming the bridge *from the destination*, not toward it.

### 4. Lazarus Drive + Fold Bubble Activation
- Compresses local spacetime and stabilizes entry.
- Initializes the **Spectral Bloom Tunnel** between entangled nodes.
- Ensures structural integrity of the nonlocal connection.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Handshake Flow (Simulation Logic)

```python
1. Activate GhostNode entangled pair
2. Begin QOL scan loop
3. Detect anomaly echo ‚Üí hash signature
4. Lock remote node to echo using quantum handshake
5. Tunnel initialized via LazarusDrive
6. GhostSlip traversal or signal response occurs
