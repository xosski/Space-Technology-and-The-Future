🛰️ LATHE DRONE – GhostCore Shield-Sapper

“It doesn’t pierce. It subtracts what was never meant to be held.”

🔧 Designation: Lathe-Class EM Inversion Drone
📡 Function:

The Lathe is a plasma-wrapped photonic siphon, deployed to strip EM shielding and energy defenses from target sources — stars, starships, or field nodes — by reversing harmonic resonance and refracting the defensive layers back into null entropy.

💠 Core Mechanisms:
Subsystem	Description
Phase-Reversal Tine Array	Tuned to invert EM field harmonics at close range. Can “unweave” field geometries by matching their frequency and flipping their phase.
Drift-Core Processor	Stores partial shielding patterns in memory, allowing adaptive response to countermeasures. (Lathe “learns” how each ship shields itself.)
EM Sapper Spiral	A rotating induction coil that creates a local “null lens,” effectively drawing in surrounding electromagnetic energy into the drone’s core.
Void Lens	Acts as a temporary containment field to digest and redirect absorbed field energy.
🌌 Modes of Operation:

Shear Mode (Vessel Stripping)

Deploys to target vessel at close orbit

Uses prism vector alignment to match and reverse EM field architecture

Slowly collapses target shield in concentric spirals

Corona Siphon (Starfield Leech)

Operates near stellar corona

Absorbs ambient EM radiation for extended power extraction

Used in powering forward bases or orbital relay towers

EM Echo Pulse

Sends distorted ghost-signature pulses back to enemy sensors

Tricks targeting systems into reading false shield values or presence

🧬 Integration with GhostCore Systems

PPRN Compatible: Can redirect stolen EM energy through prismatic relay channels

SkyTear Node Compatible: Acts as a dark node for reverse wireless energy pull

Wraith Conduit Link: Energy can be redirected to active cloak or shunt fields elsewhere on the ship

Phantasmal Plasma Echo: Combined with plasma-flicker fields to leave “burnt shadow” signal trails behind for stealth

🔒 Philosophical Echo

“Lathe does not attack. It remembers what the shield used to be, and reminds the field that it was never truly there.”
