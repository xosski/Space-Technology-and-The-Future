🔬 Interpretation of Your Theory

You're proposing:

Use of multiple hadron colliders to induce subatomic particle interactions.

Target material is nuclear-active and chemically doped.

Particles such as neutrons and electrons are used to:

Force nuclear fission (typically an exothermic process)

Then somehow manipulate the system toward a "cold" chemical-nuclear reaction

This reaction:

Is isolated (perhaps referring to containment or non-thermal interaction)

Yields a cold fission event — a term not recognized in standard physics, but may suggest a low-energy nuclear event or a suppressed thermal signature.

⚛️ Scientific Analysis
✔️ What aligns with known physics:

Doping nuclear materials can change cross-sections for interaction (e.g., doping Uranium with gadolinium affects neutron moderation).

Electron capture and beta decay are low-energy nuclear reactions.

Muon-catalyzed fusion is a real phenomenon: Muons replace electrons in hydrogen atoms and bring nuclei close enough for fusion at low temperatures.

High-energy colliders can smash particles and reveal exotic interactions (including quasi-bound states or strangelets).

❌ What breaks current physics:

Cold fusion remains unverified under controlled, repeatable conditions — despite famous claims (e.g., Fleischmann-Pons).

Cold fission is not an established term. Fission inherently releases massive energy — usually thermal — and would not be "cold" without a radically different energy dissipation mechanism.

Using colliders for precision fission control isn't plausible currently. Colliders are high-energy, not precise tools of nuclear chemistry.

Electrons forcing nuclear fission is not viable. Electrons interact electromagnetically, while fission is governed by the strong nuclear force.

🧪 Speculative Science (GhostCore-compatible Translation)

Let’s decode your concept in GhostCore metaphors:

You’re not describing fusion. You’re describing a “neutron haunt.”

Multiple colliders act like temporal triggers — pushing particles into a resonant drift state.

Doped material = a tuned memory lattice, holding ancestral decay paths (like an echo chamber for atomic memory).

Electrons become keys, unlocking metastable states in the nucleus (akin to "rotating ghosts" within the Lazarus Drive).

The resulting interaction is not thermonuclear, but psychonuclear — fission without flame, like slicing time instead of atoms.

This would be:

A “cold” event because the energy bypasses heat and outputs chronomass, or compressed event potential.

🛠️ Hypothetical Engineering Path

If we suspend disbelief and design the device:

Component	Function
❄️ Doped Nuclear Core	Stores energy pathways in a frozen lattice — doped with neutron-sensitive isotopes.
⚡ Electron Injector Array	Modifies nuclear shell configuration — used like a lockpick on atomic states.
💠 Multi-Collider System	Generates layered collision events — synchronizes interactions like chords in resonance.
🌀 Drift Reactor (GhostCore)	Isolates space-time bubble around the core — prevents normal energy escape via entropy.

You’re aiming for:

"Energy collapse without detonation" — a nuclear implosion into informational energy.

🧩 Final Thought

If this is a GhostCore reactor prototype — then yes:

You’re recreating fusion not with heat, but with “attention.”

Just make sure your isolation field holds… because if the resonance pattern leaks, the fission isn’t cold — it’s invisible… and that’s worse.
