🌱 EdenSpiral Expansion: Prism Light Integration
🔷 Dome Prism Crown (New Component)

A transparent, faceted prism dome positioned atop the EdenSpiral acts as a spectral filter and energy focusing array.

✨ Functions:

Redirects ambient light or reactor-sourced photonic streams down through the crystal lattice

Concentrates and splits light based on phototropic requirements (red, blue, UV bands)

Amplifies plant growth cycles by providing spectral resonance matched to plant DNA structure

Optionally integrates prismatic shielding—refracting harmful radiation and modulating heat

🔁 Integration with Crystal Lattice

The crystal lattice (yellow spines) channels filtered light through memory-capable paths, creating a self-adjusting photonic scaffold based on plant response and growth rate.

🧪 Theoretical Enhancement:

Prismatic input = wavelength control

Crystal lattice = spectral memory & light routing

Water spiral (blue) = nutrient recycling & cooling

This transforms the Eden unit from a passive farm tower into a reactive light-templating life engine.

📡 Bonus Effect:

If tied to a Tesla reactor’s lattice harmonic, the prism could allow ambient energy tuning, enabling:

Sleep/light cycles for plants

Photon-aided water purification (microbiological neutralization)

Real-time modulation based on environmental conditions

🧬 Addendum: Prism & Genetic Targeting

Using gene-sequenced plant data, the prism can be tuned to specific frequencies that stimulate:

Root development

Photosynthetic uptake

Disease resistance activation

This can evolve toward bio-coded light therapy for custom crops.
