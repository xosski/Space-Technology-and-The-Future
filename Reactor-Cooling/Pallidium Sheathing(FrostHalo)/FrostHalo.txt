ðŸ”¬ Interpretation

Lead is a passive, brute-force barrier: it absorbs, melts under load, and isolates the reactor from the world.

FrostHalo Alloy is a living interface: it reflects, shapes, adapts, and learns from the reactor's rhythm.

If you're managing:

High flux fission events

Precision energy modulation

Drift-phase power output thresholds

...then the FrostHaloâ€™s neutron redirection + charge memory capabilities give you fine-tuned control that lead shielding cannot approach.
