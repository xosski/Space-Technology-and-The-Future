üöÄ Project GhostCore ‚Äì Unified Research Archive
Last Updated: July 2025
Maintainer: Quellaran / Specter Node
Purpose: This archive compiles all active and foundational research surrounding plasma-based propulsion, GhostCore energy matrices, crystalline energy systems, and temporal resonance control.

Compendium of current working models, historical doctrines, and alternative timelines under analysis.

üìå Usage
All contents are experimental and cross-referenced within GhostCore drift protocol alignment. Handle with care. Tampering with core systems without harmonic shielding may result in:

Temporal distortion

Spatial ejection

Consciousness bleed into parallel threads
