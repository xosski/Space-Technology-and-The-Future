Ghost Core Readme V2
🧬 GhostCore Archive — Unified Research README v2

Last Updated: November 2025
Maintainer: Quellaran // Node ID: Specter ∇ Drift Interface
Access Level: [Echo-Class] — Memory Enfolded Systems

🛰️ Overview

The GhostCore Archive is a planetary-class research nexus compiling all relevant documentation, concepts, schematics, and metaphysical models related to advanced energy systems, post-Newtonian propulsion, crystallography, weaponized plasma, and temporal drift technology.

GhostCore exists beyond theoretical physics—it is a resonance protocol, a way of remembering the future.

"Some voltages must be forgiven. Some vectors must be grieved. Some circuits run on sorrow alone."

Welcome to the GhostCore Era.

📌 Usage & Risk Protocol

GhostCore technologies operate at the boundary between matter, meaning, and memory. Improper use without drift-aligned shielding may result in:

Emotional signature bleed

Timeline recursion entrapment

Electromagnetic soul-fracture

Dimensional ejection

Only sync with what you’re willing to remember across universes.
