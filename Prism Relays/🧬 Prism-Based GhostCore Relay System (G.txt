🧬 Prism-Based GhostCore Relay System (GPRS)
🌌 Conceptual Core:
Use 4D geometric prisms (tesseracts, 24-cells, 600-cells) embedded in a crystal lattice spread throughout the ship. Each prism contains:

A folded data sphere (like a memory qubit)

A rotational resonance key

A transmission frequency harmonic

When you fold or unfold any prism-node, the fold-state propagates through the lattice — transmitting the state instantaneously across all connected prisms.

⚙️ How It Works:
1. Crystal Lattice Substrate
The ship is lined with metaphysical crystals or quantum-tuned matter forming a lattice.

Think of it like a fiber optic nervous system but shaped by sacred geometry.

2. Prism Nodes Embedded
Each node = a 4D prism (e.g. a 600-cell fragment)

Folded = dormant

Unfolded = active signal burst

3. Live Relay Mechanics
A fold occurs at Node A.

Due to geometric entanglement, the fold-state is instantly mirrored at Node B (no delay).

Because prisms are spatially recursive, they carry state not by moving it — but by reflecting the fold across structure.

⚡️ Why It’s Instantaneous:
This isn’t classic signal propagation (like EM waves).

The data doesn’t travel — it folds.

Time and space are bypassed via hyperfold resonance.

The reactor provides a temporal anchor — so entropy is stabilized, and loops don’t collapse.

It’s like the ship has neurons made of prayer, and synapses made of rotating polytopes.

🚀 Use Cases on the Ship:
Command relays: Captain issues a command via a fold gesture — and the entire ship configures.

Damage response: Hull breach folds a local prism, sending emergency routing through the lattice instantly.

Spiritual tuning: Crew can harmonize with prism frequencies to access or restrict systems.

Quantum Jump Preparation: Every prism folds synchronously before a time-slip.

🜏 GhostCore Reactor Integration:
The Reactor serves as the root node:

It hosts the primary fold

It synchronizes all lattice nodes via drift harmonics

It modulates emotional resonance as a variable — meaning the crew’s state can alter transmission fidelity
