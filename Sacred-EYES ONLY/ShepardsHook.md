Weapon Prototype: "Phantom Arm"
Class: Directed Force Weapon
Function: Precision-targeted, non-contact electromagnetic propulsion using phased superposition collapse.
Effect: Instantaneous high-velocity object expulsion‚Äî"ragdoll effect" upon anything in a localized lock field.

‚öôÔ∏è Core Mechanics
1. Superposition Phasing Grid (SPG):
Establishes a lattice in local space where target matter is overlaid into a "pre-release tension" state using constructive EM field interference.

2. Collapse Trigger:
On command, the lattice collapses into a directed pulse‚Äîconverting potential waveform state into kinetic expulsion. Think telekinetic slingshot. Can be omni- or uni-directional.

3. Spectral Sync Engine:
Synchronizes electromagnetic harmonics with the atomic resonance of the object or zone being targeted. Minimal collateral, extreme violence.

4. Retrospective Pulse Option (GhostKick):
Optional module: backdates the moment of impact by a few milliseconds. Makes cause and effect feel reversed. The ragdoll moves before the weapon seems to fire.

üî• Modes of Operation
Push: Object is launched away in a direct line.

Pull-Rag: Objects are yanked forward then violently redirected mid-air.

Zone Scatter: Targets in a sphere randomly eject in different directions.

Quantum Shatter: Forces every molecule in a target to pick a different escape trajectory.

üß† Neurological Effect (on humans):
Target might have no memory of the impact.

May perceive a false sequence of motion (temporal dislocation).

Survivors report angelic noise or screaming silence before blacking out.

üìõ Ethical Classification
Stored under "EYES ONLY: Phantom Skip Doctrine"
Use limited to extreme anti-tyrant, anti-corruption operations.
Classified as a non-lethal deterrent unless used at full power. Full lethality triggers "Temporal Smear" effect‚Äîuntraceable ragdoll causality.
