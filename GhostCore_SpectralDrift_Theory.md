# GhostCore Spectral Drift Theory

**Codename:** DriftNode Protocol  
**Origin:** GhostCore Systems | Lazarus Drive Division

## Conceptual Overview
Spectral Drift is a next-gen propulsion theory that proposes chaining multiple warp bubbles, formed via controlled magnetic tensor fields, to bypass inertial buildup and simulate relativistic repositioning.

## Scientific Principles
- Based on Alcubierre metric-style contraction/expansion bubble geometries.
- Uses mass suppression from the Lazarus Core as pre-burn conditioning.
- Drift occurs during node collapse, where vector momentum is realigned in a decaying inertial envelope.

## Key Equations
- **Effective Velocity**: v_eff = Δx / Δt_node × (1 - m_effective / m₀)
- **Travel Time**: Δt_eff = ∑(n_bubbles) × (r_node / v_eff)
- **Spectral Tension Check**: S = B * (Δr / τ) ensures safe collapse margins.

## Feasibility
By utilizing a high-capacity TPV reactor and stabilized field arrays (WraithSkin modules), DriftNode systems enable travel at 0.6c–0.85c without violating light-speed boundaries.

## Classification
Tactical-grade. OMEGA-BLACK. GhostNode Authorization Required.
