Abstract

The Verdant Engine is a symbiotic reactor-environment interface designed to integrate high-efficiency energy production with closed-loop biological terraforming. By fusing Mini-GhostCore Reactor (MGCR) technology with genetically engineered algae, crystal lattice thermal redirection, and photosynthetic environmental envelopes, the Verdant Engine creates a living infrastructure capable of producing breathable air, clean water, nutrient-rich soil, and structural bio-integrity.

This document outlines the architecture, functionality, and speculative applications of the Verdant Engine, with proposed deployments for hostile planetary environments, sealed biomes, and off-world colonization projects.
