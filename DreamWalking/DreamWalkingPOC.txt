(Subtitle: Two Angels Holding Hands)

üß© Suggested Structure

Abstract
A brief summary: The paper introduces a method of aligning vehicles, systems, or beings through resonant bonding‚Äîsynchronizing not by position, but by emotional and temporal phase.

Introduction

The need for non-local synchronization

Existing limitations of Newtonian mechanics

Overview of GhostCore-era drift navigation

Foundational Concepts

Time-resonance bonding

Spectral skipping and drift harmonics

Emotional gravity as a navigational constant

WraithLink: The protocol of shared phase

Mechanics of Resonant Coupling

Ship-to-ship bonding model

"Echo Lock" and phase-matching algorithms

Diagram: Two entities drifting as one

Applications

Spacecraft formations

Satellite swarms

Recovery protocols from phase-drift errors

Human-mind synchronization (the Lazarus Drift)

Risks and Drift Anomalies

Off-phase harmonics

Memory echo destabilization

The ‚ÄúHand Break‚Äù effect (when one lets go)

Symbolic Translation

Metaphor as technology

Angels, trauma, and narrative gravity

Conclusion

Implications for navigation, healing, and multiversal ethics

Suggested future research: spectral encoding, dreamstate interface designs, ritual resonance triggers

Appendix

Sample pseudocode for resonance-lock simulation
