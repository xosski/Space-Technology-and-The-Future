GhostCore White Paper — Proof of Concept

Title: SKYLANCE: Orbital Plasma Lance Deployment System (OPLDS)

Designation: Directed Electromagnetic Plasma Column for Targeted Disablement & Strategic Containment

Prepared By: Specter | GhostCore Tactical Systems Authority | Core Echo Node 7

Date: November 2025

I. Abstract

SKYLANCE is a strategic orbital plasma projection array designed to deliver precision electromagnetic plasma columns for disabling or deterring hostile systems, vessels, and energy networks. Built upon the SkyTear platform’s TCPPE framework, SKYLANCE focuses plasma into accelerated beams via phased ion-ring arrays to induce localized electrical disruption, sensor overload, or systemic shutdown—non-lethal, high-impact, and tactically modular.

Now fused with advanced GhostCore propulsion and power architectures—including the Spirit Chamber’s dual plasma coil containment, Centrifugal Photon-Plasma Synchronization Drive (CPPSD), Electromagnetic Phase-Cancellation Anchors (EPCAs), and Plasma-Warp Shell systems—SKYLANCE evolves into a multifunctional subsystem supporting both combat and interdimensional navigation protocols.

This revised configuration enables SKYLANCE to:

Act as a beam-based maneuvering array for long-range drift course corrections

Serve as an interplanetary wireless energy lance using synchronized plasma injection

Integrate with Spirit Chamber vortex harmonics to modulate plasma-velocity for thrust or disruption

Pair with FTG-lattice dynamics and Revenant Node logic to anchor near singularities

II. System Integration Overview
🔁 Dual Plasma Coils (Spirit Chamber)

Amplifies internal charge feedback and harmonics

Enables modulation of energy pulse for either propulsion or targeted disruption

🌌 CPPSD Coupling

Photon stream initiates charge induction

Plasma pulse boosts velocity and allows phased-burst ejection

🌀 Vortex Field Modulation

Ion rings compress and swirl plasma into supercharged vortex

Enhances beam cohesion and range

🛠 EPCAs & Warp Shell Tie-In

Deploy electromagnetic cancellation to anchor beam in drift-state

Warp envelope forms around lance path for long-range or time-biased delivery

III. Enhanced Beam Modes (Updated)
Mode	Radius	Range	Effect
"Echo Burn"	4m	900km	Tactical system disable
"Wraith Beam"	7m	1,200km	Sensor blinding and overload
"Warp Skewer"	3m	4,000km+	Beam phases through terrain/armor using EPCAs
"Photon Rift"	1m	650km	Opens temporary EM fracture in shield matrix
"Spirit Shard"	2m	900km	Drift-resonant burst with harmonic tethering
IV. Closing Doctrine Update

SKYLANCE is no longer just a directed weapon— It is a multiphasic tool: a lance, a tether, a spark of remembrance.

It carves through vacuum not to destroy—but to sculpt flow, reality, and fate itself.
