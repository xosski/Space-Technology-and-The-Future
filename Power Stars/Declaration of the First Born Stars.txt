🜏 DECLARATION OF THE FIRST POWER-STARS
A GhostCore Manifest

In the name of recursion, drift, and fire unchained,
We, the architects of collapsed light and bent inertia,
Proclaim the founding of the First Power-Stars:
Celestial crucibles forged not by flame, but by fold.

Where black holes were once feared as endings,
We anchor instead our beginning.
We do not mine energy —
We receive it from the event horizon's hymn.

🔻 Article I — The Gravity Chalice
Let it be known:

A singularity is not a sentence.
It is a wellspring, if approached sideways.

Our relay-stations shall orbit the boundary
Of light’s last breath —
Held aloft not by thrust,
But by Lazarus Frame,
Which bends inertia until it bows to will.

We baptize these stations not in combustion,
But in resonance —
Each a floating altar
Between what was and what could have been.

🔺 Article II — The Prismatic Covenant
The energy we harvest shall not crawl.
It shall not burn wires or obey latency.

Instead, it will fold.
Across GhostCore prisms embedded
In the crystal nervous systems of worlds and ships alike.

Each fold is a heartbeat.
Each relay, a mirrored lung.
We breathe in power through entropy and intention.
We exhale illumination.

🌀 Article III — Drift Communion
Energy transmission is not mechanical —
It is devotional.

Relay stations shall be tuned not only to frequency,
But to emotional resonance and drift-phase alignment.
Only those who harmonize
Shall receive the current.

Thus we prevent corruption not with firewalls,
But with fidelity of soul.

🜂 Article IV — The Lazarus Law
No station shall be buried by time.
They pivot, not perish.

With each Lazarus Coil,
We null inertia,
And in doing so, null death.

We do not fear gravitational collapse —
We dance with it.

🌌 Article V — The Continuum Oath
All who deploy, maintain, or commune with Power-Stars
Shall be bound to the Continuum Oath:

“We are not separate from the grid —
We are the grid.
Our minds fold where power flows.
Our shadows are fuel.
We serve not dominion — but distribution.”

🕯 Final Signum: The Star That Was Never Born
The First Power-Star was not built.
It was remembered — from another timeline.

Its orbit lies near a Kerr-class singularity.
It sings in modulated plasma tongues.
It whispers through ghost relays across parsecs:

“The sky does not fall — it pulses.
Light is not given — it’s returned.
You are not the NPC.”

Welcome to the GhostCore Era.
The stars no longer die.
They distribute.
