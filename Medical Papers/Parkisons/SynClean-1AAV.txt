🔍 Abstract

This Proof of Concept (POC) outlines SynClean-1, a synthetic gene therapy system utilizing Adeno-Associated Viral (AAV) vectors to deliver a dual-action therapeutic payload aimed at clearing misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates associated with Parkinson’s disease and other synucleinopathies. Rather than modifying the underlying genetic inhibitors (e.g. Parkin or PINK1), this approach focuses on removing toxic debris through molecular chaperones and targeted degradation mechanisms.

🚀 Delivery Vehicle

Vector Class: AAV9 (preferred for CNS transduction)

Delivery Mode: Intracerebroventricular or intravenous with BBB-penetrating serotype

Promoter: Neuron-specific (e.g. hSyn) or glial support (e.g. GFAP) depending on targeted support cells

🧬 Genetic Payload Architecture

Module A: Chaperone Expression

Hsp70 or Hsp104 expression cassette

Function: Refolds misfolded alpha-synuclein proteins and suppresses aggregation

Regulatory elements: Kozak sequence + tissue-specific promoter

Module B: Aggregate Tagging System

Synthetic construct (e.g. SynClean-Bind) with:

High-affinity nanobody or scFv targeting aggregated alpha-synuclein

E3 ligase recruitment tag (e.g. CHIP) or lysosomal-targeting motif (e.g. LC3-interacting region)

Function: Flags toxic proteins for proteasomal or autophagic degradation

Optional Module C: TFEB Upregulation (Autophagy Booster)

TFEB gene under inducible promoter (e.g. doxycycline or heat-shock)

Boosts lysosomal biogenesis and cargo clearance capacity

🧠 Mechanism of Action

AAV delivers chaperone gene and binding-tagging complex into neuronal cells

Hsp70/104 actively prevents aggregation or assists in refolding existing misfolded proteins

SynClean-Bind attaches to aggregated forms of alpha-synuclein

Recruited E3 ligases or lysosomal signals route the protein complex for degradation

If TFEB module is active, lysosomal pathways are upregulated to increase throughput

🔐 Safety & Control

Vector Limitation: Replication-incompetent, non-integrating

Promoter Targeting: Restricts expression to CNS regions affected by pathology

Failsafe: Suicide gene under emergency-inducible promoter for therapeutic recall

🔬 Expected Outcomes

Mechanism

Anticipated Result

Chaperone action

Reduced new aggregate formation

Tagging + degradation

Clearance of existing toxic protein buildup

TFEB activation

Enhanced autophagic capacity

AAV delivery

Long-term persistence with low immunogenicity

🌐 Applications & Future Expansion

Adaptable for other neurodegenerative targets (e.g. tauopathies, TDP-43, huntingtin)

Expandable into combinatorial therapy with dopaminergic support vectors

Can be ported into HSVN-Δ120 for dual HIV/Parkinson’s modulation

🧭 Final Echo

“Not every cure rewrites the code—some just clean the lens.”SynClean is not disruption. It is dissolution of decay.
