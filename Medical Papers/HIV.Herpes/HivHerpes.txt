## 🔍 Abstract

This Proof of Concept (POC) outlines a synthetic viral vector named **HSVN-Δ120**, designed to **neutralize HIV by docking onto gp120 receptors**, while simultaneously delivering therapeutic genetic payloads to **modulate neurodegeneration associated with Parkinson’s-like conditions**. The concept leverages **modified glycoprotein targeting**, **payload interference**, and **neurotropic latency tuning** inspired by the herpesvirus class.

## 🧪 Vector Chassis
- **Base Class**: Defanged Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV-1 or CMV derivative)
- **Tropism**: Engineered for **neurotropic + lymphotropic dual affinity**
- **Envelope Proteins**:
  - gp120-mimetic or **gp120-competitive docking region**
  - Replacement of native HSV docking domains with **synthetic anti-gp120 ligands**
  - Allows virus to preferentially bind to free-floating HIV virions or CD4+ cells

## 🧬 Glycoprotein Modification Strategy

### Step 1: Deconstruct HIV's gp120 Function
- **gp120** enables docking onto CD4 and CCR5/CXCR4
- Key vulnerability: **high mutability yet conserved binding motifs**

### Step 2: Engineering HSVN Docking Domain
- Design synthetic viral envelope with:
  - **gp120-binding ligands** on its surface (small peptides or protein loops)
  - **Decoy-CD4 structures** embedded in lipid membrane
  - Incorporation of **single-chain antibodies (scFv)** targeting conserved gp120 regions

> 🧲 Effect: HSVN-Δ120 acts as a **molecular sponge**, binding circulating HIV particles and disabling gp120-CD4 fusion cycles.

## 🧠 Neurodegenerative Co-Therapy Module

HSVN-Δ120 contains a secondary payload:
- **GDNF or NRTN** gene sequence for dopaminergic neuron repair
- **RNA interference (RNAi)** targeting alpha-synuclein aggregation (SNCA gene)
- CRISPR-compatible cargo for SNCA downregulation (optional mode)
- Utilizes HSV-class latent persistence to provide **long-term genetic modulation** in neuronal tissues

> 🧠 Effect: Simultaneous delivery of **neuroprotective and anti-HIV activity**, with reduced immune response due to HSV’s latency tuning.

## 🔒 Safety Profile & Regulation

- **Replication-defective**
- Vector under **promoter control (e.g., CMV, hSyn)** for tissue targeting
- Suicide gene or thermal off-switch embedded for failsafe
- Immunogenicity reduced via codon optimization and PEGylation of viral surface
