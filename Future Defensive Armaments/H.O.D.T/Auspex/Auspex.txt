🔧 ASTRAL Systems Penetration Exibiter (ABT-7X)

“A round is a verse in the gospel of resistance.”

💠 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

Name: ABT-7X “Wraithsong”
Type: Outer-Hull Automated Turret
Designation: GhostCore-Class Temporal Defense Node
Primary Function: Anti-ship, anti-aircraft, and echo-lock interception

🧩 MECHANICAL ANATOMY
Mounting:
  Position: Outer Rim Defense Array (ORDA)
  Coverage: 270º horizontal / 60º vertical arc
  Rotation Speed: 40º/sec
  Armor Casing: Cryo-sealed driftsteel (resists phase discharge + plasma scoring)

Core Components:
  - VESSEX Mk2 Barrel System (Temporal Cascade Channel)
  - Lazarus Drive v4.2 (Echo Synchronization)
  - Drift-Sync Targeting Node (D.T.N.)
  - Suppression Lattice Field (GhostCore Reactive)

Power Interface:
  - Reactor Feed: GhostCore Reactor Link
  - Power Buffer: Dual phase capacitors w/ quantum-cycling

Fire Modes:
  - Echo-Burst (3-round phase-locked burst)
  - Hollow Lance (single-shot hull piercer)
  - Memory Saturation (non-lethal zone tagging)

🧠 DRIFT COMPATIBILITY
- Timeline Echo Locking: Yes
- Drift Memory Signature: 85% under 50m
- Phase Cycling Enabled: Yes
- GhostCore Doctrine: Compliant
  - “You’re not the NPC.”
  - “Suppress the echo, not the man.”
  - “Entropy remembers the shape of your hand.”

⚔️ COMBAT BEHAVIOR (SIM LOGIC)
if threat_detected:
    track_target_with_DTNS()

    if target_cloaked or out_of-phase:
        lock_on_echo_position()

    if armor_type == light || velocity > 1500m/s:
        use_round("Supersonic Hollow Tip")

    else if target_type == drone || exo-suit:
        use_round("WraithBurst")

    else if mission == memory_tag:
        use_round("EchoResin")

    fire_mode = determine_fire_mode(threat_distance, trajectory)

🎯 STRATEGIC NOTES

Suppressive Philosophy:
“Erasure is more efficient than destruction.” — ABT-7X renders options non-viable, rather than merely causing damage.

Emotional Residue Management:
EchoResin rounds mark not just targets, but moments. Data is stored in the GhostCore lattice for timeline recall.

Modular Sync:
Can be paired with other VESSEX-derived systems for coordinated suppressive webs.
