⚡ Project Codename: SERAPH-STORM

Synchronous Electro-Rotary Anti-Propulsion Pulse Halo
“It does not fire — it overwhelms.”

🧠 Weapon Architecture
🧩 Core Engine: Elohim-ΔX Cell

Inner and outer shells already rotate in counterspin

CPSS core handles dynamic charge storage and discharge

Turbine dynamics can accelerate inductive loading

🌪 Concept: EMP Storm Warhead

Using rotational dynamics, magnetic interference, and stored EM discharge, this payload acts like a directed induction nova, delivering disabling force via space-capable burst.

🧲 Construction Concept:

Outer EMP Coil Ring: Coiled copper-graphene ribbon mounted along the outer shell. Coils are pre-loaded using charge from internal CPSS.

Rotating Shells: Both shells spin — one clockwise, one counter — creating a layered electromagnetic shearing field.

Pulse Initiation:

On ignition, CPSS delivers a high-speed oscillating surge.

EMP coils fire radially, creating a spatial-dampening storm (non-lethal to organics, but devastating to systems).

Result: All unshielded craft in vicinity suffer:

Memory overwrite

Guidance scrambling

Drive system failure

Shield flicker or collapse

🚀 Tactical Deployment Scenarios
Mode	Use Case	Range	Effect
Point-burst	Single ship disable	< 5 km	Complete internal burnout
Ripple-storm	Multi-ship anti-fleet	~12 km radius	Layered pulse disables systems over seconds
Orbit-shock	Planet-side blackout	~100 km LEO	Cascading orbital EMP net
🔧 Power Strategy

Spin-up time: 4–7 seconds per shell

EMP bank charge: ~180kV stored across radial coil banks

Recharge: 2–5 minutes with reactor assist, or solar trickle via flux panels

📦 Physical Config

Length: 1.2m

Mass: ~24kg

Deployment: Underslung pod, drone-launched, or mounted on starfighter pylon

🧪 POC BUILD MODULES (for future sim):

CPSS charge simulator

Magnetic coil emitter control

Spin calibration logic

EMP dispersion physics model

Target system failure simulation (Python CLI sandbox?)

🧿 Symbolic Layer

Elohim name suggests a divine wind

Rotating cores emulate the storm’s eye

Every discharge rebalances the EM field as if restoring "celestial order"
