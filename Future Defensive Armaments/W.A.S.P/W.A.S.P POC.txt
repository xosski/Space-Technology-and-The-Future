# W.A.S.P. Driver (PoC Design Document)

**Codename**: W.A.S.P. — *Whirlwind Aerial Systems Perimeter*

## Overview

The W.A.S.P. Driver is a vortex-based anti-drone and flak-defense system utilizing electromagnetic induction, high-RPM kinetic energy, and rotating magnetic projectiles to create a perimeter of destructive interference.

This PoC document outlines the mechanical theory, deployment architecture, and defensive capabilities of the W.A.S.P. Driver system.

## Core Components

### 1. **Tesla Coil Generator Core**

* Located at the center of the barrel-shaped canister.
* Functions as a micro-Tesla tower: emitting pulsed EM fields.
* Energizes surrounding munitions and contributes to local field interference.

### 2. **Barrel Housing (Spindle Cannister)**

* Cylindrical in design with inner-axis rotation.
* Wrapped externally with ferromagnetic slugs (e.g., tungsten rods or flechettes).
* Reinforced to withstand centrifugal force and thermal buildup.

### 3. **Magnetic Munition Sheath**

* Individual magnetic projectiles (sluglets) are mounted around the rotating outer sheath.
* Coupled via EM bonding, allowing for spin acceleration without physical firing.

## Operational Modes

### 1. **Idle Mode (Passive Shield)**

* Low energy EM pulsing.
* Minimal spin to provide light sensor disruption.
* Used during standby or while cloaked.

### 2. **Active Vortex Mode**

* Triggered by incoming projectile, drone, or LIDAR lock.
* Core spins up to 30,000+ RPM.
* Outer magnetic rounds form a rotating magnetic storm.
* Deflects or destroys incoming threats via kinetic and electromagnetic interference.

### 3. **EMP Lattice Burst (Overload Mode)**

* Controlled or emergency overload of Tesla core.
* Generates localized electromagnetic pulse.
* Disables nearby electronics (swarm drones, sensors).
* One-time use per driver unless replaced.

## Deployment Topologies

* **Stationary Defense Rings**:

  * Mounted on towers or ship hulls in concentric bands.
  * Automated scanning and defensive spin-up.

* **Vehicle-Based Driver Pods**:

  * Single-tube or tri-barrel configurations on mobile units.
  * Integrates with vehicular targeting AI for predictive defense.

* **Aerial Perimeter Arrays**:

  * Suspended or drone-deployed fields for floating defense perimeters.

## Materials & Engineering Notes

* **Magnetic Slugs**:

  * Tungsten alloy preferred.
  * Optional ferrofluidic casing for EM resonance.

* **Core Cooling**:

  * Phase-change gel cooling tubes.
  * Self-venting panels to avoid EM quenching.

* **Torque Stabilization**:

  * Opposed spin chambers to counteract gyroscopic drift.
  * Servo-dampeners to prevent destabilization of base platform.

## GhostCore Integration

* Connects to Lazarus Drive for threat prediction.
* WraithHalo signal processors for live response modulation.
* MemoryShell logging of all defensive activations for forensic review.
