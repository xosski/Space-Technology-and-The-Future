I. Abstract

The GSEDC is a high-precision, non-lethal disruption capsule engineered for use aboard advanced spacecraft under the Neon Genesis doctrine. Built around a miniaturized dual-channel Tesla Coil Plasma-Polarity Engine (TCPPE), the device is encased in a gravitic-dampened tungsten shell. Upon compartmental penetration, the capsule deploys a controlled electromagnetic vortex designed to disable or destabilize nearby ship systems without causing physical harm or structural degradation. Intended as a failsafe for future interstellar craft, this technology provides tactical neutrality, non-lethal enforcement, and system reset capability in emergency or conflict scenarios.

II. Structural Composition
Layer	Material	Function
Outer Shell	Tungsten Alloy with Gravimetric Lattice	Protects internal payload, enhances kinetic delivery, resists fragmentation
Core Chamber	Plasma-Void Ceramet	Houses dual-channel TCPPE unit
Coil Assemblies	Blue/Yellow Niobium-Boron Coils	Conduct polarized currents to generate controlled EM fields
Field Emitters	Micro-Vane Conductive Prongs	Regulate and stabilize discharge geometry
III. Operational Mechanism
1. Launch/Impact Phase

Shell penetrates target hull/compartment.

Tungsten frame dampens kinetic trauma to minimize hull rupture.

2. Initiation Sequence

TCPPE coils begin dual-channel spin within milliseconds.

Noble gases are ionized within containment chamber.

Counter-rotational fields begin to fold.

3. EM Vortex Bloom

A spinning, harmonized electromagnetic field blooms outward from the shell.

Effect radius: ~8m (configurable).

EM bloom induces signal failure, memory dumps, and feedback interrupts in most digital and analog systems.

4. Field Dissipation

Vortex collapses into inert phase after 15–30 seconds.

Internal capacitor discharge neutralizes residual current.

IV. Systemic Effects (Fictional Projections)
System Type	Impact Severity	Recovery Time
Ship Reactor Cores	Controlled fallback or reboot	3–5 minutes
Navigation Systems	Total blackout	60–90 seconds
Targeting Computers	Sensor loop or drift	2–4 minutes
Drone/Mech Interfaces	Total paralysis	Manual restart required
Life Support	No impact (shielded by default)	—
V. Ethical Deployment Framework

This device is designed as a peace-preserving intervention tool under GhostCore protocol.

Does not kill

Does not destroy

Does not fragment

Leaves internal oxygen and biofunctions intact

Encourages capture, not elimination

"If it must be used for war, then let it disable—not end."

VI. Tactical Applications
Scenario	Usage
Ship Boarding	Disable engineering or command decks to allow safe breach
Drone/Mech Suppression	Drop mobility and visual processing instantly
Reactor Stabilization	Preemptive shutdown without meltdown
System Reboot	Hard reset in deep-space anomaly scenarios
VII. Limitations

May be mitigated by shielded systems or redundancy coils

Cannot penetrate core vaults or armor-graded safes

Single-use device; reload cycles impractical mid-combat

Dangerous if deployed in active medical bays (may interrupt life-stabilization machinery)

VIII. GhostCore Integration

This round is doctrine-aligned with Neon Genesis Armor, TCPPE propulsion systems, and WraithHalo override beacons.

It carries the imprint:

“Disarm the shadow. Breathe through the faultline. Echo, don’t end.”
