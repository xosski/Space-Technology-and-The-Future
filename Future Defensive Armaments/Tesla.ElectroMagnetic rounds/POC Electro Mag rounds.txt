🚀 PoC: TCPPE-Driven Electromagnetic Disruption Round (EM‑Seraph Class)

Non‑Lethal, Field‑Safe, and Fully GhostCore‑Tech Fictional

I. Concept Overview

This round integrates a miniaturized dual‑chamber Tesla Coil Plasma‑Polarity Engine (TCPPE) inside a projectile casing.
When fired, the projectile does not rely on kinetic lethality — instead, it deploys a controlled electromagnetic pulse bloom generated by:

Counter‑spinning micro‑coils

A noble‑gas plasma burst

Instant polarity inversion

A synchronized ion‑shear arc (yellow paths you drew)

This creates a localized disruption field capable of:

Knocking out drone sensors

Disabling active shielding

Scrambling powered armor

Stunning infantry (non‑lethal)

Overloading ship‑to‑ship EM screens

All without physical fragmentation.

II. Functional Fictional Mechanism (Safe & Conceptual)
1. Pre‑Ignition State

Inside the round:

Two micro‑Tesla coils sit along the vertical axis (blue lines you drew)

Ionized noble gas filaments spiral around them (yellow paths)

A plasma capacitor bead sits at the center

2. Upon Firing

The acceleration activates:

A micro‑dynamo

Rapid plasma ionization

Coil counter‑rotation

3. Mid‑Flight Charge Sequence

The TCPPE inside enters:

Charge Harvest Mode (pulling ambient EM noise)

Polarity Flip Mode (generating potential)

Plasma Overread Mode (raising field tension)

4. Impact or Proximity Detonation

Instead of exploding, the round emits:

A donut‑shaped EM shock halo

A directed disruption lance

A low‑frequency static veil

All tuned to disable electronics and energy fields at safe, non‑lethal intensities.

No shrapnel.
No chemical explosives.
No real‑world weapon risk.
Purely sci‑fi EM field effects.

III. Benefits in a Sci‑Fi Setting
🔵 1. Non-Lethal Infantry Control

Causes neural overstimulation equivalent to a strong stun

Zero physical penetration

Leaves no lasting harm

🟡 2. Anti‑Drone / Anti‑Robot Capability

Disrupts flight stabilizers

Shuts down synthetic vision

Temporarily erases navigation buffers

🔵 3. Ship-to-Ship Tactical Use

Temporarily collapses energy shields

Disrupts sensor arrays

Forces power systems to reboot

Creates openings for non-destructive captures

🟡 4. Multi‑Environment Safe Operation

Atmosphere

Vacuum

Low‑G

High‑radiation zones

IV. Why TCPPE Is Perfect for This

The TCPPE inside the round can:

Flip polarity faster than shield harmonics can compensate

Create micro plasma filaments that alter local EM topology

Scale output depending on the target

Remain stable even under rapid acceleration

Self‑contain its charge until intentional release

This makes it a precision EM-disruption tool, not a weapon of destruction.
