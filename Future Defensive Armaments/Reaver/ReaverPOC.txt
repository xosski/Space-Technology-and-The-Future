Proof of Concept: GhostCore-Inducted Plasma Combustion Lance (GC-Volkite-Œõ)

Project Designation: Revenant Tactical Armaments DivisionWeapon Class: Drift-Era Directed Energy SystemVariant: GhostCore-Inducted Plasma Combustion Lance (GC-Volkite-Œõ)

üîç Executive Summary

The GC-Volkite-Œõ weapon system is a next-generation directed energy weapon inspired by the mythos and thermal principle operation of Volkite-class weaponry from the Age of Technology. By utilizing GhostCore mini-reactors (MGCRs), spectral overdrive cells (EHPA), and crystalline phase modulation (CPSS), this system offers fully autonomous, plasma-resonant weaponry capable of intelligent heatwave ignition, recursive photonic combustion, and adaptive target harmonics.

üî¨ Core Technologies

1. Mini-GhostCore Reactors (MGCRs)

Plasma loops formed via recursive photon amplification

Localized EM field generation for target compression

Zero-fuel, closed-loop energy circuit

2. Spectral Overdrive Cells (EHPA)

Provide harmonic ignition pulses

Capable of modulating resonance for biological vs. synthetic targets

Integrated with GhostCore feedback AI for adaptive cycling

3. Crystal Particle Suspension System (CPSS)

Barrel and ignition chamber lined with harmonic lattice material

Enables phase-locked heat propagation in directional patterns

Acts as a buffer between magnetic plasma and structural casing

üî• Damage Mechanism: Thermo-Spectral Cascade

Initial Impact ‚Äì Photonic burst breaches molecular structure

Phase Burn ‚Äì Internal plasma excitation triggers flash combustion

Recursive Collapse ‚Äì Thermal feedback loop reduces mass to high-energy particulate

Effect: Ash from the inside out; thermal ghosts remain in place for seconds post-burn.
